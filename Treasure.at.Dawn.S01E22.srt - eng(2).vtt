Apricot Kernel and Perilla Powder.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.070
It's used to treat colds.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.210
As expected, the blessed water is just a disguise.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.770
The medicine is in the copper pot.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.120
They only know this one remedy.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.030
But they are treating people.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.960
That's why they can only treat colds

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.280
and can't treat other diseases.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.310
You're right.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.030
The three Heavenly Tutors asked us

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.200
to use the heart-eater grass unique to the Tianyi tribe

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.630
to make the poisonous fog,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.200
pretending to be the Hole Ghost

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.850
to snatch babies under the age of one year

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.930
to expand our tribe.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.600
I thought the Tianyi tribe would get better and better.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.430
However, I found out that they were trying to control the Tianyi tribe

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.900
to make a profit for themselves.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.280
Are you coming to us

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.160
to get rid of those three witch doctors?

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.080
We are going to hold a blessing ceremony

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.110
for the babies who join our tribe.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.310
I'd like to ask you

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.110
to expose those witch doctors in public.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.240
Now that you know their evil deeds,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.550
why don't you expose them?

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.080
The witch doctors have been here for more than a decade.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.310
Their God's Blessing scam

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.110
deceived a generation of the Tianyi tribe.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.640
In the Tianyi tribe, they are the embodiment of the gods.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.390
Even if you tell everyone

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.320
the truth,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.810
they won't believe it.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.740
Are you saying

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.600
the people of the Tianyi tribe

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.520
don't believe you?

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.000
Exactly.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.800
That's true.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.080
Did you forget it? They said the people you healed

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.910
were healed by the gods.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.830
Yeah.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.030
What should we do?

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.080
Only by letting the people of the Tianyi tribe know

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.390
who the witch doctors really are

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.520
will they understand

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.110
that they have been deceived.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.470
Okay.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.310
We'll take care of it.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.480
But we have a question.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.770
What is it?

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.830
Five years ago, you snatched a baby

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.240
in the Chang's Mansion.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.990
A doorman chased you.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.200
His name is Song Yuan.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.150
Do you know him?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.760
He was the first warrior before you

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.430
to brave the fog

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.640
and retrieve a child.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.200
Although he was poisoned by the heart-eater grass,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.040
he got out.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.270
When he was about to die,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.920
our people

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.250
took away the Mountain-shaped Jade from him

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.940
and gave it to the Heavenly Tutors.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.080
Anyway, he broke out of the fog. We don't know if he was dead or alive.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.430
Is the Mountain-shaped Jade in the Tianyi tribe?

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.730
If you can get rid of the witch doctors for us,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.460
I can call the shots

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.240
and give the jade to you.

What should we do with Fu Sheng?

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.590

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.520
If we let them go on like this,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.520
they will be a big trouble.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.590
I fought the Hole Ghost

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.350
for four hours

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.040
to take back the baby.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.320
I had severe internal injuries.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.080
Just now,

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.470
I used all my skills

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.870
to expel the ghost in the baby.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.440
I'm afraid

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:40.920
I'm going to die.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:41.800
Immortal.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.280
Thank you

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.830
for everything.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.160
Immortal, tell us.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.800
What can we do to save you?

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.990
There is only one medicine

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.870
that can save me.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.830
But it's very expensive.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.350
I can't afford it.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.560
Forget it.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.990
It's my destiny.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.750
Honey, get the money.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.870
Get all our money.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.510
Immortal.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.400
It's all we have.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.800
I know it's not enough.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.110
I'll raise money for you.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.080
Take it first.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.710
No.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.020
I can't take it.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.990
Immortal, you almost lost your life

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.510
trying to save our baby.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.470
You must take it.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.800
Otherwise, we won't sleep well.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.200
I...

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.710
Immortal, please take it.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.440
I...

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.320
All right. I'll take it.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.560
Please stop here. I don't want others to see me.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.230
What are you afraid of?

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.040
Immortal, you got my baby back.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.320
I'll tell everyone in the slums

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.080
what you did.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:58.510
Don't.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.630
Please don't do that.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.160
I forgot to tell you.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:05.830
The Hole Ghost

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.990
comes every month on the 15th.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.960
I wounded him this time.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.230
He dares not get back at me.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.710
But he would get back at you.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.960
Maybe the next time he comes,

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.440
he will not only snatch your baby

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.040
but also hurt you.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.080
Immortal.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:32.590
What should we do?

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.870
You'd better move out of here

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.200
and leave Xichuan.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.280
Don't tell anyone your baby is back.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.400
In case you get into trouble.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:47.680
I...

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:49.320
What's wrong?

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.400
What's more important than life?

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:54.680
All right.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.710
Immortal, we'll do what you say.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.040
Good for you.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.080
People of the Tianyi tribe.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.940
Yesterday, Fu Sheng touched his sick body

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.040
when the gods appeared.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.470
He pissed the gods off.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:25.840
The gods don't save those who do not respect him.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.230
So, this young man got sick again.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.750
The gods love people.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.590
I'll make the sick ghost show up

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:37.980
and expel it.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.480
Expel it.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:41.580
Expel it.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.690
Bring Fu Sheng up.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.280
Expel it.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.100
Expel it.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:45.640
Go.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.920
Expel it.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.820
- Expel it. - Expel it.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:50.690
Expel it.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.240
Go.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:14.590
Did you see it?

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.710
The sick ghost showed up.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.160
Put out the fire.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.080
Ashes would trigger his asthma.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.320
The sick ghost found his ally again.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.920
I'll invite the gods

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:27.510
to expel the ghost.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.080
This smell is familiar.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.350
The earth is under the feet, and the sky is above the head.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.560
Set up the incense table to invite the gods.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.080
Gods, bless us.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.370
I'll show you the gods.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.830
I'll show you the gods.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.510
There are really gods in this world.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.200
There is a sick ghost in him.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.590
It got its ally here to make trouble.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.040
All internal organs are gates.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.470
The good and the bad meet here.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.510
Gods, please help us.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.230
Please expel the ghost in the Tianyi tribe.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.320
You'll strangle him.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:53.870
Out of the way.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:57.510
Fu Sheng.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.710
You're really the ally of the sick ghost.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.960
How dare you interrupt my spellcasting?

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.270
No. The sick ghost comes back.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.510
Gods, please help me.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.790
Help me.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.960
Here are doubles of the gods.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.160
They're only half as powerful.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.160
If this continues,

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.440
the Tianyi Tribe will be under the shadow of the sick ghost

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.440
and destroyed.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.510
Please help me.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.100
Help me.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.600
The sick ghost entered your body.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.510
Are you all right?

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:23.160
I'm fine.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.750
It means

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:28.750
he's deceiving everyone.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.750
Let's take him away.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:33.400
Okay.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.270
Aren't you afraid of the ghost? Out of my way.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.680
Fu Sheng is the sick ghost.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.030
Catch Fu Sheng.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.610
Catch Fu Sheng.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:46.620
Stop.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:48.850
Hurry.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.750
Stop.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:55.680
Immortal.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:57.840
Immortal, what's wrong with you?

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.790
I fell.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.470
Who are you?

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:03.920
How could you do this to him?

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.160
Tell them about it, Immortal Wang.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.200
Tell them how you tricked them

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.160
into giving you all the money.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.510
He has the ability.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:14.990
My wife and I saw it with our own eyes.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.660
Kid, don't talk nonsense.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:20.640
Look.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.270
Look how miserable they are.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.440
He was willing to believe me.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.790
Are you a liar?

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.360
I wouldn't say that.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.550
I just played some tricks

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:32.930
to make some money.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:34.440
No way.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:36.780
I heard a knock on the door but didn't see you.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.200
I saw the ghost you caught

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.470
on the yellow paper.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.880
Draw a ghost with alkaline water

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.200
on the paper.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.640
When the alkaline water is dried up,

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.120
the ghost disappears.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.600
Then, spray turmeric water on the paper.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.920
The ghost will appear.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.510
He tricked you.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.200
Here's your money.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.680
This is all that's left.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.840
He spent all the other money.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.360
You liar.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.320
Get up.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.600
Get up.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.090
You stole my baby?

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.200
It was the Hole Ghost, to be precise.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.230
The Hole Ghost stole your baby.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.600
Then, he pretended to be a Heavenly Tutor and sent him back.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.030
Their purpose is to make money.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.520
Do you remember

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.990
what he asked you to do last night?

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.920
You'd better move out of here

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.270
and leave Xichuan.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.470
Don't tell anyone your baby is back.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.880
In case you get into trouble.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.200
Nonsense.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.920
You fooled me.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:39.990
Now I know why you were afraid

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.310
people would see you.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.200
You want the people you cheated out of all their money

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.790
to leave their homes.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.070
You're awful.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.360
You liar.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:49.550
I'll kill you.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.880
I'll kill you.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.960
If you kill him,

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:59.120
you'll be a murderer.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.440
You just got your baby back.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:02.710
Think about it.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.710
He stole my baby.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.400
I can't calm my anger unless I kill him.

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:10.230
I asked you not to kill him.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.510
I didn't ask you not to hit him.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.880
Wait.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.270
Screw you.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.310
We can't go on like this.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.710
They will catch up with us.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.750
Let's split up.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:34.600
I'll draw them away.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:35.160
No.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:36.270
We should save him.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:37.400
I'm from the Lord's Mansion.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:38.400
They won't do anything to me.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.960
Don't worry.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.310
Be careful.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.440
Come on.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:47.920
Chase them.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.960
Stop.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.440
This way.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:50.650
Hurry.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:51.780
Stop.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:53.160
Chase them.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.560
Stop.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.050
Hurry.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:55.710
Stop.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.300
Chase them.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:56.990
Stop.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:57.700
Chase them.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.920
- Chase them. - Hurry.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.250
Go.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.250
Hurry.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.010
Stop.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:01.640
Hurry.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.550
Stop.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.160
You're running fast.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:13.360
Tie her up.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:15.720
Let go.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.570
Why are you tying me up?

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:17.660
Young Mistress.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.720
We don't want to give you a hard time.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.880
I'll let you go

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.790
as long as you tell me where Fu Sheng is.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.080
Are you Wang Zhong?

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:27.990
Yes.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.160
Young Mistress, you got there, huh?

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.310
I want to cooperate with you.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.420
But I don't know.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.310
What should we do?

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.790
Tian Gou.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.230
Young Mistress.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.310
I'll give you one last chance.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:44.950
If you...

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.180
I don't know.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.310
It's useless for you to force me.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:49.360
Okay.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.710
It's your choice.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.140
Tian Gou.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:05.600
Lead the way.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:17.610
How are you doing?

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:20.080
Physician Fu.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.280
Physician Fu, I'm sorry.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.080
It's all my fault.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.440
I overheard your conversation with the chief

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:30.310
and told Immortal Qin.

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.950
I didn't expect to be taken advantage of by him.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.470
That's why we're here today.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:38.400
I thought I was going to die today.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.080
I didn't expect you to save my life.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.310
Physician Fu, I'm really sorry.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.680
You don't have to.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.340
You had an asthma attack.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.160
You're lucky to be alive.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.790
Get up, Tian Yu.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.360
What's done is done.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:05.680
Can you tell me why you did it?

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.400
I have asthma.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.750
Immortal Qin saved me several times.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.750
I thought

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.600
he was my lifesaver.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.360
If that's the reason,

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.510
I won't blame you.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.160
Physician Fu.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.440
Do you want to continue to fight against Immortal Qin?

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.880
The villagers have seen his magical power.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.120
They trust him.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.790
You'd better

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.990
leave here.

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.360
You are no match for him.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.880
What did he do?

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.600
Is it like what he did today?

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.640
It's the first time

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.470
I've seen such powerful magic.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:54.510
Ordinary people

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.230
cannot see the gods appear.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:59.640
Tian Yu.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.840
Have you ever seen clay dolls

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:03.470
in the Tianyi Tribe?

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:05.080
Clay dolls?

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:05.640
Yes.

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.840
I have one with me.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:07.640
Really?

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.550
Show me.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.550
It's smaller than the clay doll I've seen.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.440
The clay doll head that I've seen is hollow.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.680
Physician Fu.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.230
How come you've seen this before?

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.030
I saw it in a family where their baby was snatched by the Hole Ghost.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.470
That one was used.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.160
Used?

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.750
How do you tell them apart?

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:40.400
Physician Fu.

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:42.030
Have you ever made a clay doll?

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:44.680
You must know

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.920
that clay dolls are made not only with clay

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.400
but also

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.750
with honey, cotton, and paper.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.440
They are used to increase the stickiness of the clay.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.160
When Immortal Qin

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:55.200
makes a clay doll,

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:56.880
he makes

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.920
a hollow head first.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:00.990
Then stuff it with cotton

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.750
and heart-eater grass.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.620
When he goes to steal a baby on the 15th,

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.400
he ignites the clay doll's head

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.840
and puts it in the house.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.200
When everyone in the house

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.710
is poisoned and hallucinated,

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.230
he sneaks into the house

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.710
and trades the clay doll for the baby.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:18.600
I see.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:21.950
The clay doll's head was hollow

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.310
because it had heart-eater grass in it.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.200
It became hollow

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.470
after it was ignited.

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:30.440
Heart-eater grass.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.200
Your chief said

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.270
it was the raw material for the poisonous fog outside your tribe.

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:37.990
Right?

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:38.750
Yes.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:51.840
Chief.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:52.880
Where is everyone?

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.750
Gu, you're finally back.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.030
Something happened this morning.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.000
Everyone thought Fu Sheng

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.280
had become a ghost

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.830
and would kill everyone.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.480
They went to the mountains

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.040
to catch Fu Sheng.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:09.760
What?

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.160
Where is Wen Jue?

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.150
The Young Mistress left with Fu Sheng.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.080
Her whereabouts are unknown.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:16.960
Keep an eye on him.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.280
I'm going to the city to get help.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:18.910
Okay.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.520
Go get help.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.910
Come back before something big happens.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.460
You, the Tianyi tribe,

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.370
have lived in this environment for a long time.

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:28.890
Will you be poisoned by the heart-eater grass?

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.440
We developed an immunity

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.160
to the heart-eater grass.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:34.990
We don't hallucinate because of it.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.950
Why do you know so much?

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.710
I have asthma.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:43.840
So,

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:46.080
I am often with Immortal Qin.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.270
I helped him make clay dolls.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.160
Did you make this?

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.160
Yes.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:55.880
Immortal Qin saved my life several times.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.200
So I made a doll of him

00:27:58.550 --> 00:27:59.680
and carried it with me.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.790
Are those clay dolls

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.600
made of the same material?

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.440
Yes.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:07.710
I see.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.400
It smells the same

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.310
as what Qin Miao

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:18.400
threw into the fire.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:20.990
What does it taste like?

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.600
There's agarwood,

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:32.510
sandalwood,

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:34.710
cinnabar,

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.510
and mandragora in it.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.600
I see.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:47.710
People of the Tianyi tribe

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.920
are immune to the heart-eater grass.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.230
If Qin Miao wants to establish his authority

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:53.600
in the Tianyi tribe,

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.680
he has to find a new hallucinogen.

00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.310
So that

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.710
you will be hallucinated.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.080
Physician Fu,

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.400
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:09.640
What hallucinogen?

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.200
There's only one hallucinogen in the Tianyi tribe.

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:14.710
And that's the heart-eater grass.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:21.230
The first three herbs are easy to get.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.440
But mandragora

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:26.840
is difficult to get.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.440
As far as I know,

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:31.400
There are very few medicine shops

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:34.200
in Xichuan that sell it.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:39.840
Tian Yu.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.310
Qin Miao is a witch doctor.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.840
Have you seen where he collects herbs?

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.440
Wang Bo and Wang Zhong

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:56.550
go to the Dead Man Cliff

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.030
every once in a while.

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.000
Maybe that's where they collect herbs.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.360
Dead Man Cliff.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.790
Where is it?

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.360
Immortal Qin named it.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.030
He said he saw ghosts

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.310
wandering

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:14.030
under the cliff.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.030
They will catch people who pass by

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.440
so that they can be reincarnated.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.120
Have any of you seen it?

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.990
A bold villager went there.

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:29.510
He said he saw ghost fire

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.200
floating up under the cliff.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:32.990
After that,

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:34.640
no one dared to go there anymore.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.470
Tian Yu.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.470
Can you take me to the Dead Man Cliff?

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.310
Physician Fu.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:40.640
You saved my life.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.270
I'm willing to take you there.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:44.400
Good.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.030
They must be in this cave.

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:05.880
You four, search.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:06.510
Yes.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:34.840
There's someone over there.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.600
You, keep an eye on her.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.310
The rest of you, chase him.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.170
Yes.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:47.360
Go.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:56.760
Untie me.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.110
Let's go.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.090
Stop.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.670
Wait.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:13.330
We're tricked.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.920
Go back to the cave. Hurry.

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:25.830
Fu Sheng, I saved you again.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.170
This is the Dead Man Cliff.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.120
Don't be scared.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.710
The so-called ghost fires

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.440
are just wildfires.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:56.120
It's beautiful.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.230
Where did the wildfires come from?

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.720
It is beautiful.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:02.280
I used to see wildfires

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.910
in mass graves.

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:07.360
Physician Fu, I've told you.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.340
There are ghosts under the cliff.

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:11.880
Let's get out of here.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.080
I'm going down there and have a look.

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.550
What if the vine breaks?

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:37.990
Please

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:39.360
grab the other end of the vine.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:40.990
My life is in your hands.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.120
Mandragora. Just like I thought.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:58.560
Useless.

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:00.830
You're all useless.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.270
Good-for-nothing.

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:05.640
You can't even catch Fu Sheng, the sick ghost.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.230
Forget it.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.310
Forget it.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.960
I've treated you well.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.640
When the sick ghost attacks again,

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.390
I can save my life.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:22.960
But you...

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.160
Immortal, please save us.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.390
Immortal, please save us.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.200
I can't save you.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.750
You can only save yourselves.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:33.790
Immortal, please point out the way to us.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.520
If you want to save yourself, you should catch Fu Sheng, the sick ghost.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.640
I caught Fu Sheng, the sick ghost.

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:46.350
I caught Fu Sheng, the sick ghost.

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:49.640
Tian Yu.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.960
How did you catch them?

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:53.960
Heavenly Tutor.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.710
I woke up in the mountains

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.230
and found them sleeping next to me.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.200
So, I found a chance

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.040
to knock them out, tie them up,

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:01.910
and bring them here.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:02.950
Good.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.160
Good job.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.080
The gods will bless you.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:08.520
Thank you, Heavenly Tutor.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.480
Bring Fu Sheng up.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.160
Immortal-binding Rope.

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:40.350
Ghost-binding Rope.

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:42.640
Demon-capture Bottle.

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:44.680
With these three treasures,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.640
I'll expel the sick ghost.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.200
No.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.750
The sick ghost has become one with the Fu Sheng.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.160
The sick ghost is Fu Sheng.

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.350
Fu Sheng is the sick ghost.

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.080
If we want to destroy the sick ghost,

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.830
we have to kill Fu Sheng.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.640
Wang Zhong, beat the drum.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.530
Okay.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.200
There are three lights on you.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.390
One on your head and two on your shoulders.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.350
Put out the three lights.

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:28.270
The sick ghost has nowhere to run.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.200
What happened?

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:49.350
That's the body of the sick ghost.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:56.270
Wang Zhong, stop beating.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.830
Heavenly Tutor.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:59.910
It's not me.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:01.960
Who's there?

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.290
What happened?

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:04.630
What happened?

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:05.680
Who's there?

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:06.680
Who?

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:16.640
Looks like you're not the only one who's sober.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.560
Chief.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.080
It's so loud over there.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:24.350
Did something happen?

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.120
Won't you go there?

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.270
No rush.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:29.680
Wait for a while.

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.430
I'm your double.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.080
I did all the bad things.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.480
You took all the merits.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.000
It's you.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.230
You got everybody sick.

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.960
You killed everyone who disobeyed you.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.200
You've killed many people.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.730
I'm wronged.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.790
I hate it.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:15.310
Shut up.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.040
Shut up.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.230
Nonsense.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.000
Fu Sheng, this is your trick.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:23.350
Don't trust him.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:25.430
Fu Sheng is the essence of the sick ghost.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.390
It's Fu Sheng's trick.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:28.680
Don't trust him.

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:30.600
Whether I'm a ghost or not

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.350
is not up to you.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.480
How about this?

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:36.430
Let's invite all the gods here.

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:37.860
Let them say

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.050
which one of us

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.100
is a ghost.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.260
Do you dare?

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.830
Yes, let the gods judge.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.430
Let's see whose problem it is.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.410
Let the gods judge.

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:52.380
Let the gods judge.

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.250
Let the gods judge.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.860
Let the gods judge.

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.520
Let the gods judge.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.230
Immortal Qin.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:02.960
Do you want me to invite the gods?

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:06.200
I'll invite them.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.520
What's

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.710
your spell?

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:17.770
The earth is under the feet, and the sky is above the head.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:19.600
Set up the incense table to invite the gods.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.540
Gods, bless us.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.910
Ladies and gentlemen, don't worry.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.960
I'll show you the gods.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:26.700
Come on.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:46.640
No.

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:49.330
No way.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.080
How could I have a hallucination?

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:53.560
Are the gods here?

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:55.830
The momentum is great.

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:57.960
- The gods are here. - The gods are here.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.780
The gods are here.

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:02.680
It's fake.

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:04.600
It's all fake.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.660
It's his trick.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:10.330
Qin Miao.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.120
You've sinned greatly.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.850
You do bad things in our names.

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:20.010
We'll punish you today.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:26.750
It's fake.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.720
There are no gods or ghosts in the world.

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.350
It's an illusion.

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.440
You finally admitted it.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:36.900
There are no gods or ghosts in the world.

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.440
Your tricks

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.480
are all illusions.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.400
So what?

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:51.880
I let them see

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.520
what they see.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.960
If I don't want them to see this,

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.000
I'm still the Heavenly Tutor here

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:58.670
when they wake up.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.800
What a coincidence.

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:08.670
Wang Zhong has long stopped beating the drum.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.920
That is to say, you're in a hallucination.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.880
So,

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.620
they will hear

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.510
what I want them to hear.

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:19.800
Have a guess.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.920
Did they hear what you just said?

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.550
You tricked me.

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:47.000
Who was responsible

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:48.870
for the Raid outside Xichuan?

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:51.300
Lord Wen.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.760
My father?

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.450
Kill them as soon as possible.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:58.140
All of them.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:05.840
