Can I take a few days off?

00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:51.100
You haven't wrapped up

and you want to apply for leave already?

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:54.040

Thanks, Boss.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.380
He's been at school the whole time?

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.950
He can study at home too.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.920
He's really hardworking.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.290
These past few months,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.640
his grades have kept improving.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.360
He comes home less and less.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.290
I think

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.830
he's pushing himself.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.990

won't settle for mediocrity.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.450
He's always ranked

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.760
around Top 10 in school.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.660
He's probably

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.780
in seclusion,

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.230
trying to get better.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.830
I don't want to disturb him.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.230
I can only praise

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.550
and encourage him.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.760
Who said you couldn't praise people?

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.390
You're getting pretty familiar with it.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.320
Practice makes perfect.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.710
Besides,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.880
Li Wu is indeed outstanding.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.450
Yes.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.080
He's impressive.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.200
How about this pen?

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.360
It feels very clean.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.880
This color.

00:03:56.222 --> 00:03:57.060
But I think this one

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.880
suits him better.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.950
True.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.220
But if Li Wu

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.360
finds out about the price,

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.200
will he feel pressured?

Since it's a NCEE gift,

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.450
I want it to last

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.480
and mean something.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.950
Just don't tell him.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.000
Excuse me.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.630
A top-student face?

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.040
The kind

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.680
that looks like she gets great grades

00:10:18.688 --> 00:10:20.311
and always stays on the right track.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:22.700
Both your temperaments

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.560
are kind of similar.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.530
But she's probably

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:26.866
way more outgoing than you.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:28.750
Her grades are indeed good.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.470
She's my classmate in Rocket Class.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.200
she helped me a lot.

00:10:32.844 --> 00:10:33.990
Then you should thank her.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:37.577

who's easy to get along with.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.320
So am I easy to get along with?

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:46.280
You?

00:10:46.355 --> 00:10:48.160

I've ever dealt with.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:51.400

00:10:51.622 --> 00:10:52.420
You don't remember?

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.490
You were so awkward

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.580
when you first came.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.610
Every time I talked to you,

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.630
I would get a headache.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:59.710
And now?

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.230
Any better?

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.022
Now you're tall, handsome, obedient,

00:11:04.044 --> 00:11:05.400
and you get good grades.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.680
You're my perfect,
100-point little brother.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.680
Come on.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:10.710
Let's go home.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.530
(Remember to eat breakfast.)

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.110
(Start living healthier.)

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:42.890
The core

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:43.890
of our theme

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.610
is using love as the bond.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.650
Through our unique fragrance,

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:48.820
we build a link

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.350
between consumers and the brand.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:51.520
(Thank you.)

00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:53.110
(I slept really well last night.)

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.100
(And the cake was great.)

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.280
We've launched...

00:14:57.022 --> 00:14:57.980
(What are you doing?)

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.700
Scented Memories micro-film series.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.770
Each micro-film

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:01.630
tells a story...

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:03.870
(I'm in a meeting.)

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:05.700
(Why don't you take today off)

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.950
(and rest at home?)

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:15.800
(The new system's on a trial run,)

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.110
(so the schedule's tight.)

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.730
Falling in love and staying together.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:22.370
But sometimes

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.460
it's because

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.370
a couple

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.420
has a conflict.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.040
(Good luck.)

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:33.940
That's it

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.400
for today's livestream.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.610
To thank

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.100
all the darlings who've supported me

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.560
and followed me all this time,

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.700
I've prepared

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.800
a few small gifts.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:43.940
Next,

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:44.850
I'll contact

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:46.340
the top five fans

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.680
on our ranking.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:48.980
I'll leave you a message.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.400
Send me your address.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.560
See you next time.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.460
(Livestream Ended)

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:06.950
This ID...

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:10.990
I thought it was a random passerby.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.022
I didn't expect them
to be a die-hard fan.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.730
(Thanks for your support.)

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.266
(Remember to send me your address.)

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.340
(Thanks for your support.
Remember to send me your address.)

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.400
Uncle.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.000
I really didn't expect

00:16:50.022 --> 00:16:51.490
you'd be into this stuff in private.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.866
You're even her top supporter.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:53.980
How could you

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.610
nag me not to use my phone every day?

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:56.644
None of your business.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.160
Are you a monkey?

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.266
If you're done cleaning up,

00:16:59.266 --> 00:17:00.310
hurry back to your office.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:01.630
My place isn't a hotel room.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.240
Your place is close to the office.

00:17:06.266 --> 00:17:07.711
It's just more convenient to stay here.

00:17:09.355 --> 00:17:10.220
You don't even know

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.180
how much Li Wu's

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.520
been making me work overtime.

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:16.730
They're giving you a gift

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:18.133
and even asking for your address.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.330
Give it back.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:21.320
I'm almost done typing.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.870
If you don't want it, give it to me.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.280
Why waste a freebie?

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:30.870
Leave.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.320
Fine.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:38.830
Top supporter.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:39.830
Get lost.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:56.500
(Super Speed Delivery)

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.800
How big is your parcel?

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.870
I'm not sure.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:12.590
See if this is it.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.620
(Chun Chang)

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.240
Yes.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:18.240
Thank you.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.430
Remember to write
your phone number next time.

00:18:20.488 --> 00:18:21.840
You put my courier station's number.

00:18:21.844 --> 00:18:23.000
How am I supposed to find you?

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:23.660
Got it.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.140
Thanks.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.000
Don't mention it.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.480
(Stray Cat.)

00:19:11.844 --> 00:19:12.800
(A hairbrush as a gift.)

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.320
(May it help you
smooth out a beautiful life.)

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:30.760
Why isn't Dad back yet?

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.530
Your dad's been helping students

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:34.870
with their theses. He's swamped.

00:19:35.288 --> 00:19:36.110
Don't wait for him.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.430
He's been busy lately.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:40.110
I haven't seen Wu in a while.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:41.290
If he's free,

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.760
invite him over someday for a meal.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.800
He's all alone here.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.910
It's lonely during the holidays.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:51.660
Mom.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.088
Are you sleeping better lately?

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.240
Still having insomnia or night sweats?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.866
I feel much better.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.480
I took Lu's medicine.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:59.730
Basically,

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.080
I can sleep until morning now.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.000
That's good.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:04.940
But shouldn't you

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.140
still go back for a check-up?

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:06.720
No need.

00:20:06.933 --> 00:20:08.180
I was chatting with Lu on WeChat

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.190
a few days ago.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:10.800
I told him about my condition.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:11.590
He said,

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:12.590
"No problem.

00:20:12.622 --> 00:20:14.422
Just keep taking the medicine
to stabilize it."

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.940
Honestly, Lu's

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.110
a pretty good guy.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.280
Thoughtful and considerate.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.460
He would be

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.570
a very good

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.000
husband.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.240
I know,

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.050
but we still need to get along first.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:30.590
Look.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.980
Even if you don't pick on him,

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.430
he might pick on your daughter.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:35.670
True.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.720
This is a big deal.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:38.080
We can't be rash.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.870
But after getting to know him,

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:44.350
what do you think?

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.000
He's alright.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:50.330
Mom.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:52.560
Just let us take things slowly.

00:20:52.622 --> 00:20:54.111
Let's go with the flow, okay?

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.240
Sure.

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:56.320
Of course.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:57.830
Go with the flow.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.430
Lu, hello?

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.810
This weekend,

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.140
I'm going over to Jin's place.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.150
Do you have time?

00:21:15.355 --> 00:21:16.620
You're welcome to join if you do.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.066
I'll cook something nice for you two.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:19.860
Mom.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.520
Didn't we agree to go with the flow?

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.140
I know.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.810
I'm just giving you two a little push.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:27.000
More interaction
gives a better understanding.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.010
No problem.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:30.870
Thank you, Mrs. Cen.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.190
Remember.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.420
Make sure you clean

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.240
your place.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.330
Don't let him think

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:39.520
you're messy and unhygienic.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:40.720
It's organized chaos.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:41.870
Sure.

00:21:43.644 --> 00:21:44.670
Drink the soup first.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:45.560
It's good.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:02.560
We did it!

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.870
We did it!

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.590
I told you we would.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:08.800
How did it go?

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.000
The test passed?

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.630
The first internal test went great.

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:12.620
All that overtime

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.630
finally paid off.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.000
What did I say?

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.590
This was bound to go well.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.560
Everyone worked hard.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.420
We've cracked

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.870
the hardest part.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.620
Our new model

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.620
has officially passed

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.110
the initial AI training phase.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:29.220
Next,

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.570
we'll just need to run AB tests

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.390
to replace the old model.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.050
Let's refine everything

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:34.730
and deliver

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.240
to Mr. Guo on time.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.720
I promise you.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:38.810
This will be

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:40.190
our last overtime night this month.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:43.430
Alright.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:44.620
Shouldn't we

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.800
celebrate something like this?

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:47.933
How about the barbecue downstairs?

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.220
Everyone's

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.644
not in a hurry to go home, right?

00:22:50.644 --> 00:22:51.860
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.422
Who'd leave when there's barbecue?

00:22:53.444 --> 00:22:54.420
Barbecue is my favorite.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:54.960
Yi.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.050
I know that place.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.349
A food blogger reviewed it before.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.900
It's popular.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.630
Right?

00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.960
Then it's settled.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:00.870
Du.

00:23:01.066 --> 00:23:02.180
Call the place downstairs.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.280
Book a bigger private room

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.250
and order all their signature dishes.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:05.700
Okay.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:06.150
Okay.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:07.770
See you all downstairs.

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.430
- Sure.
- No problem.

00:23:09.866 --> 00:23:10.960
What are you spacing out for?

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.400
If you're not excited about eating,
there's something wrong with you.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:14.870
Yes.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:16.150
Come on.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:17.080
Let's go.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.720
Where are you going? Join us.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:26.390
I want to head home early today.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.040
Help me treat everyone.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.520
Order as you please.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:30.390
It's on me.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.080
Going solo?

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.810
Got a date?

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.000
Even stuffing your mouth with meat
can't shut you up.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.770
In that case,

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.240
I'm ordering the expensive stuff.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.830
I'll eat till you go broke.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:46.660
I missed it again.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.290
I'm too slow.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:49.140
Mom, I'm heading home now.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:49.960
Wait.

00:23:49.977 --> 00:23:50.720
I missed it again.

00:23:50.755 --> 00:23:52.010
You're not waiting for your dad?

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:52.660
No.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.866
I've still got to work overtime.

00:23:54.511 --> 00:23:56.420
The weather forecast said
it's going to rain.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:56.940
You'd better

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.760
not get caught in it.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.560
Got it.

00:23:59.088 --> 00:24:00.000
Be careful on the way.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:00.830
Okay.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:02.000
Hold on.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:03.630
I almost forgot.

00:24:03.866 --> 00:24:05.288
- I prepared this for you.
- Mom.

00:24:05.311 --> 00:24:06.080
Take a look.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:07.390
Guess what it is.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:10.380
Amethyst.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.080
Mom.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.800
Which group did you buy this from?

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:14.140
This is good stuff.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.150
Really good stuff.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:16.730
Be careful when you use it.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:17.620
Don't drop it.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.860
If the tips chip,

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:19.733
it'll stop working.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:20.770
Mom.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.460
How many times have I told you?

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:23.490
Stop buying stuff

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.420
from those

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.350
health chat groups.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:26.220
What

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.630
yellow crystal and blue crystal?

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.420
Do you remember

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.644
the magnetic therapy bracelet

00:24:30.666 --> 00:24:31.377
you bought?

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.860
It was exposed as a scam.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:33.350
Okay?

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.190
This one's different.

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.080
It's scientifically proven.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:38.860
Just like this one.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:39.560
And this one.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.590
They're all the same.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.390
They said

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:44.250
this thing

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.190
can improve the house's magnetic field.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.770
It contains trace minerals.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:49.480
It can

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.830
improve sleep and ease fatigue.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.860
Gosh.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.910
It's scientifically proven?

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.730
Of course, they'll exaggerate

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.090
the effects.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.900
How else

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.150
would you old folks buy it?

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:02.290
Look at me lately.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:03.390
I'm not losing sleep, am I?

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.240
It's because we have these at home.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:07.630
Of course.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:08.800
It could also be

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.810
related to Lu's medicine.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.190
It's exactly because of that!

00:25:12.688 --> 00:25:14.080
I believe it, even if you don't.

00:25:14.133 --> 00:25:15.520
- I don't.
- You have to take it.

00:25:15.644 --> 00:25:16.466
I don't believe it.

00:25:16.488 --> 00:25:17.622
- I don't want it.
- Take it.

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:19.290
You're always working overtime.

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.180
- It's bad to stay up late. Take it with you.
- I don't want it. Mom.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.430
Keep it at home.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.240
Does this thing even work?

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:54.870
Coming.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.000
Li Wu.

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.180
My mom just bought these crystals.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.430
She said it cures insomnia

00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:20.822
and told me to bring them to you.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.670
Thanks.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:26.960
I'll pack them up.

00:26:28.466 --> 00:26:29.280
You want to come in?

00:26:30.622 --> 00:26:31.760
No, I've got things to do.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:08.220
(Yi City, Sea City)

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:17.150
Hello?

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:18.430
Chang?

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.630
Are you up?

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.380
It's so late already.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.320
Who wouldn't be up?

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:25.190
Well...

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.280
Did you head out yet?

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.350
What's wrong?

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.050
Mr. Zhang

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:31.155
booked flights to Cheng City

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.870
behind my back.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.940
He wants to take me and Yuan

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.110
traveling.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:37.720
The three of you?

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:40.190
Sure.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.110
Then, the three of you go.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.190
Or I can tell him

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:46.910
to just take Yuan.

00:27:46.977 --> 00:27:48.280
I'll stay home and wait for you.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:49.240
Don't.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.350
I don't want people thinking

00:27:53.755 --> 00:27:55.290
I went back just to break you three up.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:56.110
That'd look bad.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.630
Chang.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:27:59.180
I...

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.040
I'm kidding.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.380
I haven't left yet.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.040
Good timing.

00:28:04.688 --> 00:28:06.090
The bar's been busy lately anyway.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:07.190
Just have fun.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.050
Take care of yourself then.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:10.080
Happy birthday.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:11.390
Alright, I'm hanging up.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:18.044
Sir, turn around.

00:28:18.222 --> 00:28:19.980
I'm not going to the airport.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:20.800
Let's go back.

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:21.830
Okay.

00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.080
Weren't you going home?

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.320
I missed my flight.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:03.770
Weren't you

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:04.960
going camping with them?

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.110
Pretty much like you.

00:29:08.422 --> 00:29:09.760
I finished late and missed it.

00:29:09.844 --> 00:29:11.350
Xiao Jun and the rest already left.

00:29:11.355 --> 00:29:13.200
I couldn't be bothered to go.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.320
Upset?

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.480
Is it that obvious?

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:31.190
Your emotions

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:32.630
are written all over your face.

00:29:36.533 --> 00:29:37.700
Why the sudden concern

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.910
for me?

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:40.190
Fell for me?

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.240
You're not denying it?

00:29:46.311 --> 00:29:47.777
I'll take it seriously then.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.590
Looks like you're fine now.

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:58.670
People are really weird.

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.660
Every time my expectations fall flat,

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.110
I tell myself

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.040
not to expect anything again.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.870
No hopes, no disappointment.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.080
But the next time,

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.110
I still can't help imagining
all sorts of things.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.480
You probably don't get it.

00:30:21.911 --> 00:30:23.320
It's fine. I'll be okay tomorrow.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:25.830
I think

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.240
we don't need to be happy all the time.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:33.480
Spacing out once in a while is good too.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:34.590
Just like now.

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:36.350
Don't think about happy stuff.

00:30:37.288 --> 00:30:38.870
Don't think about sad stuff either.

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:42.960
I think you're right.

00:30:44.777 --> 00:30:46.688
If I'd known, I wouldn't have gone back.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.800
I'd have gone camping with you guys.

00:30:49.577 --> 00:30:51.000
I really wanted to see the stars.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.320
You want to see stars?

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.080
Shen Yiyang.

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:40.080
From now on,

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:43.670
you'll be the one
watching the stars with me.

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:45.480
Okay?

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:52.670
Okay.

00:32:11.244 --> 00:32:12.577
That should be about it.

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:15.870
Thanks, Yiyang.

00:32:16.022 --> 00:32:16.900
Good thing you let me

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:17.730
use the lab tonight.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:18.770
Or else I couldn't have

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:19.350
run the tests.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.800
Don't be so polite with me.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:21.700
So?

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.290
How's the new model coming along?

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:24.350
We passed the test.

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:25.420
Our next step

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.180
is to run AB tests

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.111
so that the new model
can replace the old one.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.150
Good.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:33.190
Let's grab a meal together.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.660
I'll pass.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:35.620
I had a meeting at noon.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.511
By the time I finished lunch,
it was past three.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.430
But I can do a drink.

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:41.830
Okay.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.620
My friend opened a lounge bar.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.333
It's pretty nice.

00:32:44.377 --> 00:32:45.133
Want to go there?

00:32:45.155 --> 00:32:45.644
Sure.

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:46.870
Then,

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:48.390
it's my treat.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:49.480
You decide.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.590
Alright.

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.300
(Chang Bar)

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.250
So...

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:00.830
Li.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:02.010
Yiyang, you came.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:02.980
How did you two

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.560
end up coming together?

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.320
Mr. Shen?

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.333
- You two know each other?
- You two know each other?

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:17.670
I didn't expect

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:19.720
you and Chun Chang to be besties.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.110
What a small world.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:22.280
Why is that surprising?

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:24.430
Outstanding people always cross paths.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:27.490
Yiyang said

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:28.220
a friend of his

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.080
opened a bar here.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.220
I only realized after arriving

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.333
that it's Chun Chang's place.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:32.720
"A friend"?

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:35.080
Alright then.

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:37.560
Stop standing there.

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:39.760
Sit and talk.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.490
Since Li Wu is here today,

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:42.280
it's on me.

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:44.590
Since everyone's here,

00:33:44.933 --> 00:33:46.600
I'll open a bottle
from my private stash.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.400
Sure.

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:50.190
Sit.

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:51.480
Li.

00:33:51.511 --> 00:33:52.430
Four glasses, please.

00:33:52.488 --> 00:33:53.430
I'll help you get them.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:54.080
No need.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:54.960
Just sit first.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:33:59.560
Li Wu.

00:33:59.622 --> 00:34:01.290
The air conditioner's
pretty strong here.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:01.960
Sit here.

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:11.710
Thanks.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:13.840
Ice bucket.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:15.190
Thanks.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.040
Working overtime again?

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.480
I've been busy testing these days.

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:27.630
Thanks.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:28.530
Mr. Shen.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:29.630
Long time no see.

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.790
I keep hearing
Chun Chang mention you lately.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:34.670
I even said we should meet up,

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:36.630
but she never gives me a chance.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.300
I didn't expect

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.555
we'd run into each other today.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:40.820
If there's a chance,

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.800
let's meet more often.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:44.630
"Meet more often"?

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.490
Some people are so busy

00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:47.800
that you can't even book them.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:54.920
Here, I'll pour.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:58.670
Thanks.

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:00.440
Cheers.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.790
I didn't expect fate to tie us together.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.310
I think so.

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:29.750
Who is it?

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:31.840
It's me.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.630
I still can't sleep.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:49.130
Can I stay over

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:50.080
at your place tonight?

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:53.050
I'll sleep on the couch.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:54.000
I'll leave early.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:57.690
I know

00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:58.610
this is kind of abrupt.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:35:59.230
But...

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:02.900
When I was here last time,

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:03.670
I slept really well.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:08.590
I mean...

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.150
I sleep well here.

00:36:13.355 --> 00:36:14.980
Once I went home,
I couldn't sleep again.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:15.610
So maybe

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:16.840
I can only sleep here.

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:24.840
Forget it.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:28.420
I'll just go back

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.080
and try again.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:31.777
Sorry to bother you.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.000
Come in.

00:36:57.222 --> 00:36:58.820
This buckwheat pillow works better.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.590
Use this.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:08.190
Right.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:09.820
Dr. Lu said

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.270
your last checkup went pretty well.

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:13.050
Since the medicine works,

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:14.110
take it on time.

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.040
Putting them like this

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:40.310
looks like a magic formation.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.130
Am I going to

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.110
fall asleep for good?

00:37:43.755 --> 00:37:45.777
Knock three times on the wood. Hurry.

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:52.630
Actually,

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:55.000
these days I've realized

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:56.750
what really helps me sleep

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:58.920
isn't these things.

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:00.480
What is it then?

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:25.480
It's all used up.

00:38:25.533 --> 00:38:26.644
You should sleep.

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:32.920
What are you doing?

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:36.900
You're wearing slippers.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.270
You're wearing slippers too.

00:38:38.577 --> 00:38:40.050
Don't move. There's glass on the floor.

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:41.360
Put me down. You...

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:45.270
Sit still.

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:11.040
You got nervous?

00:39:13.222 --> 00:39:14.480
Men and women are different.

00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:18.977
But I'm your younger brother.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:25.911
Where's the broom?

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.360
Behind the bathroom door.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:12.840
Do you have clear tape?

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:15.480
In the drawer over there.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:49.270
Why are you staring at me?

00:40:50.155 --> 00:40:51.155
Afraid I'll do something?

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.190
I think

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:58.630
we should keep some distance.

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:04.880
Didn't we agree

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:07.440
to let go and move on?

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:34.840
But all these years I've wondered

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.440
why we split back then.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.040
You should sleep.
