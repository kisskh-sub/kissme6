Who told you to do that?

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.620
That's breaking the rules.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.960
Han Jaehun, Han Jaehun.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.630
If you write it wrong, rewrite it.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.500
Until my name is engraved

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.070
into your hands and mind.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.479
Got it?

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.210
My rules are simple:

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.860
what I say

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.400
are absolute.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.579
Haejun.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.670
Do you know why I'm like this?

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.900
Why?

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.550
Because I'm scared.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.430
Scared of...

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.430
losing you.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.890
Hyung.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.750
I won't leave you.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:14.750
I will

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.430
always be by your side.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.740
Can you promise that?

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.470
I just want to just

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.280
sleep with you in my arms tonight.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.640
Really?

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.070
Haejun.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.230
What are you thinking so deeply about?

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.640
Just...

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.720
some family matters.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.040
Oh, right.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.230
There's something important
I need to tell you too.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.100
Haejun,

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.400
I

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.020
like you.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.690
It's been a while.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.650
I heard your mom was sick.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.700
It must be hard for you alone.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.570
I'll go visit her with you.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.710
So,

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.000
can I...

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.840
be your girlfriend?

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.030
I see!

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.400
"I see"?

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.290
You're just trying to comfort me, right?

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.100
Pretending to be my girlfriend

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.000
to help me.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.790
Gosh, I'm so touched.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.390
No, I mean it.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.810
You're just like a sister to me.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.160
What a great friend.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:29.630
Haejun,

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.890
w-well...

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.150
Noona, you're wearing a scarf today too!

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.520
Is it a symbol of good luck?

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:37.180
It's okay.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.310
My mom's living expenses are settled.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.890
I just bought this scarf.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.890
Kim Haejun, are you a blockhead?

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:45.900
I'm confessing right now.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.409
A love confession
between a man and a woman.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.230
Noona.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:57.310
You're like a family to me.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.580
You're warm and admirable—

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.470
someone I can't live without.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.060
But that's not love.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.200
Fine.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.950
I got it.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.610
You're really stupid.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:18.400
Well...

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.090
I really treated you as my real sister.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.100
Ouch!

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:51.810
It hurts, right?

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.500
Only when it hurts can you remember.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.240
Hyung,

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.990
you hurt more than the thorn.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.150
Haejun!

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.000
I have something for you.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.990
What is it?

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.380
I have to leave every moment of you
in my memories.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.040
You should take it too.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.230
It's unfair if it's just me alone.
