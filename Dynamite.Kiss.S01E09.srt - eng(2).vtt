DYNAMITE KISS

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.949
EPISODE 9

00:00:53.032 --> 00:00:55.034
Ma'am, you look so beautiful today.

00:00:56.327 --> 00:00:58.705
You must be delighted
about your son's engagement.

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:03.626
Excuse me for a second.

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:11.509
It's what he wanted.

00:01:11.593 --> 00:01:14.762
In exchange for marrying
into Chairman Yu's family, I divorce you.

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:18.433
When a parent falls apart,

00:01:18.516 --> 00:01:21.519
the child's whole world crumbles.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.106
We have to become braver

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.941
and happier

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.068
for our children's sake.

GONG JI-HYEOK & YU HA-YEONG
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ENGAGEMENT

00:02:08.858 --> 00:02:10.944
Dad, what are you doing?
We should hurry up.

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:12.487
Right. Let's go.

00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:27.043
Where is she?

00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:28.711
She'll be arriving shortly.

00:02:29.462 --> 00:02:31.297
She's just unbelievable.

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:36.678
Hey, I'm almost there.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.264
Oh, you're there? Okay.

00:02:39.347 --> 00:02:40.181
See you.

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:52.694
We'll be starting in five minutes.
You can make your way to the hall now.

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:11.129
Auntie! Auntie Da-rim!

00:03:11.212 --> 00:03:13.589
-Jun, there you are!
-Auntie!

00:03:13.673 --> 00:03:15.049
-Hey!
-There you are.

00:03:16.384 --> 00:03:17.969
Auntie!

00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:19.679
"Auntie"?

00:03:19.762 --> 00:03:21.639
Be quiet. You scared me!

00:03:21.723 --> 00:03:24.183
-Should we check out that place later?
-Yes.

00:03:29.564 --> 00:03:30.648
Go Da-rim, Kim Seon-u!

00:03:30.732 --> 00:03:32.608
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

00:03:32.692 --> 00:03:34.819
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:03:34.902 --> 00:03:37.739
Jeez, you guys are still attached
at the hip.

00:03:37.822 --> 00:03:39.449
-Are you still living in the same place?
-Yeah.

00:03:39.532 --> 00:03:41.534
You might as well get married

00:03:41.617 --> 00:03:43.161
and receive the government housing benefit
for newlyweds.

00:03:43.244 --> 00:03:46.122
Hey, we're like brother and sister.

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:47.415
Right, and you're the brother.

00:03:47.498 --> 00:03:48.333
Why you little…

00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:49.959
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:03:50.043 --> 00:03:51.502
-My goodness.
-Jun, let's go.

00:03:51.586 --> 00:03:53.463
Jun, did you say hi to him?

00:03:53.546 --> 00:03:54.797
Have you been well, Jun?

00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:56.382
-Or you'll get scolded.
-You're a big boy now.

00:03:56.466 --> 00:03:58.426
Technically, I don't have a boyfriend.

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:00.470
I have a husband.

00:04:01.054 --> 00:04:03.598
You'd know better than me
what moms would like.

00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:05.558
Right, of course, I do know.

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:07.060
I do, but…

00:04:08.102 --> 00:04:09.937
It sounds like
you've never raised a child.

00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:11.022
Da-rim.

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:12.982
You've never raised a kid, have you?

00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:17.403
Ji-hyeok.

00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:22.450
Mom.

00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:27.830
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

00:04:28.498 --> 00:04:29.499
Were you waiting for me?

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.251
Very much so.

00:04:33.378 --> 00:04:36.047
You're the most special person in my life.

00:04:37.256 --> 00:04:38.257
Let's go inside.

00:04:45.932 --> 00:04:47.725
Let's welcome the stars of today's event.

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:51.312
Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok, the groom-to-be,
and Ms. Yu Ha-yeong, the bride-to-be.

00:04:51.396 --> 00:04:54.148
Friends and family, please welcome them
with a warm round of applause.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.831
Smile.

00:05:25.596 --> 00:05:29.016
We'll now proceed with exchanging rings

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.353
to signify the couple's vow
for their future together,

00:05:32.437 --> 00:05:33.688
followed by a photo montage

00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:36.190
that tells the story
of how this couple came to be.

00:05:36.274 --> 00:05:39.152
Please send them a warm round of applause.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.419
ENGAGEMENT CEREMONY VIDEO

00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:43.925
Mr. Gong.

00:06:46.302 --> 00:06:47.303
Mr. Gong?

00:06:49.388 --> 00:06:53.059
It seems our groom-to-be is quite nervous.

00:06:53.142 --> 00:06:55.937
Why don't we cheer him on
with another warm round of applause?

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.709
Just wait and see.

00:07:19.502 --> 00:07:21.879
I'm going to turn this place
upside down today.

00:07:25.091 --> 00:07:28.010
Everyone, I have something to say.

00:07:31.472 --> 00:07:33.432
The truth is, I…

00:07:40.064 --> 00:07:41.232
Oh dear.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.695
Ma'am!

00:07:45.778 --> 00:07:46.946
Mom!

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:48.239
Mom!

00:07:48.322 --> 00:07:49.907
-Gyeong-min, bring the car around. Hurry.
-Right, okay.

00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:52.159
Mom.

00:07:52.243 --> 00:07:53.411
Mom!

00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:56.455
Please wake up. Mom!

00:07:57.206 --> 00:07:58.082
Mom.

00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:00.918
Mom…

00:08:02.128 --> 00:08:02.962
Mom.

00:08:03.045 --> 00:08:04.755
Please wake up.

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:05.965
Please.

00:08:06.048 --> 00:08:07.675
Gyeong-min, step on it.

00:08:07.758 --> 00:08:08.759
Okay.

00:08:10.136 --> 00:08:11.554
You can slow down.

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:13.973
You should drive safely.

00:08:26.861 --> 00:08:27.695
Mom.

00:08:27.778 --> 00:08:29.113
Are you okay?

00:08:29.196 --> 00:08:30.990
I'm totally fine.

00:08:31.073 --> 00:08:33.492
What are you talking about?
You just collapsed.

00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:37.246
That was all an act

00:08:37.747 --> 00:08:39.290
to stop the engagement ceremony.

00:08:44.295 --> 00:08:46.505
Gosh, it seems like I got you good.

00:08:52.303 --> 00:08:54.263
She's been nothing but trouble
my whole life.

00:08:54.347 --> 00:08:55.473
Why today, of all days?

00:08:56.098 --> 00:08:56.974
Are you sure

00:08:57.767 --> 00:08:59.435
you don't want to head to the hospital?

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:01.145
This is nothing new.

00:09:01.812 --> 00:09:03.022
She'll recover if it's nothing serious.

00:09:03.689 --> 00:09:06.651
We can reschedule the engagement ceremony

00:09:06.734 --> 00:09:08.069
based on her recovery.

00:09:08.778 --> 00:09:09.612
No need.

00:09:10.196 --> 00:09:12.114
-Let's just proceed with the wedding.
-What?

00:09:14.575 --> 00:09:17.078
Wouldn't that be rushing it too much?

00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:18.371
It'll be tight if we want it to coincide

00:09:18.454 --> 00:09:20.665
with our new product launch
and overseas expansion.

00:09:20.748 --> 00:09:22.041
Save time where you can.

00:09:34.053 --> 00:09:35.012
Welcome.

00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:05.543
Mom.

00:10:05.626 --> 00:10:07.753
If you challenge that man,
he won't stop until he wins.

00:10:07.837 --> 00:10:09.505
If I just get married--

00:10:09.588 --> 00:10:11.006
This isn't just for your sake.

00:10:11.674 --> 00:10:12.842
It's also for mine.

00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:14.802
It's a little late,

00:10:15.469 --> 00:10:16.929
but I want to start living my life now.

00:10:18.514 --> 00:10:21.434
For that to happen, shouldn't I reclaim
what's mine on my own first?

00:10:23.477 --> 00:10:25.187
That's why I hired them.

00:10:25.813 --> 00:10:27.940
They're quite renowned in their field.

00:10:31.944 --> 00:10:33.237
CHEON JI-HUN LAW OFFICE
ATTORNEY CHEON JI-HUN

00:10:34.113 --> 00:10:35.364
RETAINER FEE: 500 WON

00:10:36.157 --> 00:10:39.201
Normally, my retainer fee is 1,000 won,

00:10:39.285 --> 00:10:43.038
but as you know,
this case is on a slightly grander scale,

00:10:43.122 --> 00:10:44.957
so I decided to work with Ma-ri this time.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.293
Hence, we're splitting
the retainer fee exactly in half.

00:10:47.376 --> 00:10:50.296
Exactly 500 won each.
Not a single won more.

00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:51.297
Half?

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.214
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:10:53.466 --> 00:10:57.636
Due to Ms. Kim In-ae's recurrent
depressive and anxiety disorders,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.222
Mr. Gong Chang-ho has been managing
all of Ms. Kim's assets,

00:11:00.306 --> 00:11:01.557
including her company shares.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.850
That's correct.

00:11:02.933 --> 00:11:05.478
We intend to ensure
that she regains control of her assets

00:11:05.561 --> 00:11:08.147
and facilitate her return
to the company's management.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:11.066
Natural BeBe is a company Ms. Kim
had a hand in building from the ground up.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.486
She deserves to reclaim
what's rightfully hers, doesn't she?

00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.945
Right, Trainee Baek?

00:11:15.654 --> 00:11:16.489
I'm an attorney.

00:11:17.364 --> 00:11:18.532
-Attorney Cheon.
-Yeah?

00:11:18.616 --> 00:11:22.453
Why do you keep calling me that
when I've been done training ages ago?

00:11:22.536 --> 00:11:23.996
I'm sorry, Trainee--

00:11:24.747 --> 00:11:25.831
I mean, Ms. Baek.

00:11:25.915 --> 00:11:29.293
It's just that "Trainee Baek"
rolls off the tongue.

00:11:29.376 --> 00:11:31.837
Is there anything I can do to help?

00:11:32.755 --> 00:11:35.508
Gathering evidence of the things
Ms. Kim has been subjected to thus far,

00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:38.177
as well as the evidence required
to claim her management rights,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.803
will take some time.

00:11:39.887 --> 00:11:43.015
Until then, you should act
as if nothing is happening

00:11:43.098 --> 00:11:46.185
and maintain the current state of affairs.

00:11:46.268 --> 00:11:50.314
That way, we can access
the company records without interference.

00:11:50.856 --> 00:11:53.400
At the very least,
we can't let anyone suspect a thing

00:11:53.484 --> 00:11:54.818
until we can prove

00:11:55.653 --> 00:11:56.654
that I'm of sound mind.

00:11:57.321 --> 00:11:58.822
If he catches on before then,

00:11:58.906 --> 00:12:02.368
he'll throw me into a psych ward
just to stop me.

00:12:03.202 --> 00:12:04.662
Yes, I also believe

00:12:04.745 --> 00:12:07.414
Mr. Gong is more than capable
of doing such a thing.

00:12:07.498 --> 00:12:09.625
However, such a thing will never happen.

00:12:09.708 --> 00:12:10.543
Why?

00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:11.544
Because

00:12:12.294 --> 00:12:14.088
I'm the attorney on the case.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.258
No matter what happens,

00:12:17.341 --> 00:12:19.677
we'll be sure to protect our clients.

00:12:33.607 --> 00:12:35.609
Trainee Baek, shall we go strategize now?

00:12:36.652 --> 00:12:37.486
Shall we?

00:12:38.195 --> 00:12:39.029
Let's go.

00:12:39.113 --> 00:12:41.156
Let's go do this thing.

00:12:48.497 --> 00:12:49.540
Pottery?

00:12:49.623 --> 00:12:50.499
You think so?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.168
It's a bit too light to be pottery.

00:12:54.086 --> 00:12:55.963
-Glass!
-Glass?

00:12:56.046 --> 00:12:56.964
Could it be glass?

00:12:58.007 --> 00:13:01.010
GONG JI-HYEOK & YU HA-YEONG
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ENGAGEMENT

00:13:06.473 --> 00:13:07.766
Auntie!

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:08.892
Hurry up.

00:13:08.976 --> 00:13:10.185
Yeah, I'm coming.

00:13:11.478 --> 00:13:12.313
I'm coming.

00:13:12.896 --> 00:13:13.772
Let's go, Jun.

00:13:15.733 --> 00:13:17.192
Come on. Give me your hand.

00:13:17.276 --> 00:13:18.861
Let's go.

00:13:24.158 --> 00:13:25.451
Are you sure about this?

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.540
I'm just really afraid you'll get hurt

00:13:32.666 --> 00:13:33.626
and go through a hard time again.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.464
Don't worry.

00:13:39.048 --> 00:13:39.882
I'm going to

00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:41.800
make it happen.

00:13:43.052 --> 00:13:46.680
So don't worry about anything else.

00:13:47.431 --> 00:13:49.975
Just focus on yourself

00:13:50.809 --> 00:13:52.728
and follow your heart.

00:13:54.229 --> 00:13:55.356
Got it?

00:14:14.083 --> 00:14:15.834
Don't worry about anything else.

00:14:15.918 --> 00:14:18.504
Just focus on yourself

00:14:19.296 --> 00:14:21.382
and follow your heart.

00:14:21.465 --> 00:14:22.466
Got it?

00:14:23.634 --> 00:14:25.260
Follow my heart…

00:14:33.227 --> 00:14:35.104
I've already found my luck.

00:14:36.605 --> 00:14:37.773
You, Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:14:39.817 --> 00:14:41.402
Auntie! Auntie Da-rim!

00:14:41.485 --> 00:14:42.945
-My goodness.
-Jun, there you are!

00:14:43.028 --> 00:14:44.530
Auntie!

00:14:52.121 --> 00:14:53.122
Damn it.

00:15:01.213 --> 00:15:02.256
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:15:16.979 --> 00:15:19.148
The morning meeting
will start in ten minutes.

00:15:22.901 --> 00:15:25.487
We'll officially start preparing
for the photography exhibition now.

00:15:25.988 --> 00:15:27.072
-Ms. Jang.
-Yes?

00:15:27.156 --> 00:15:28.407
-Ms. Bae.
-Yes?

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.492
You'll handle promoting the event on
online mom communities and social media.

00:15:30.576 --> 00:15:33.078
I'll finalize the pamphlets
and send them to the printer.

00:15:33.162 --> 00:15:35.706
Then I'll work on the invitations.

00:15:35.789 --> 00:15:37.958
We'll deliver the posters to supermarkets

00:15:38.042 --> 00:15:39.835
and department store
culture centers tomorrow.

00:15:39.918 --> 00:15:40.919
-All right.
-Got it.

00:15:41.503 --> 00:15:43.797
It's been a while
since I've been to a culture center.

00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:45.883
The one escape you have
when you're solo parenting.

00:15:45.966 --> 00:15:48.594
It feels like you're on an outing
when you're there.

00:15:48.677 --> 00:15:51.096
Bedtime became so much easier
after playing there all day,

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.389
-so that's what I liked about it.
-Right.

00:15:52.473 --> 00:15:55.059
-I know, right? They really love it.
-Yeah.

00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:58.520
Your kid liked it?

00:15:59.938 --> 00:16:01.190
What did he like, exactly?

00:16:02.566 --> 00:16:04.526
Well, you know…

00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:07.654
He liked all the different classes--

00:16:07.738 --> 00:16:08.989
Right, so what classes, exactly?

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:19.750
Well…

00:16:24.463 --> 00:16:26.465
I guess you're finding interest
in these things

00:16:26.548 --> 00:16:27.800
now that you're getting married.

00:16:27.883 --> 00:16:29.134
There are all sorts of classes.

00:16:29.218 --> 00:16:30.761
Flour dough classes,

00:16:30.844 --> 00:16:32.930
sensory play, tactile play,
and stuff like that.

00:16:33.013 --> 00:16:34.973
-There are loads.
-Right, stuff like that.

00:16:37.351 --> 00:16:38.268
Right.

00:16:38.894 --> 00:16:39.812
I see.

00:16:40.395 --> 00:16:41.230
Yes.

00:16:43.816 --> 00:16:44.858
Let's end the meeting here.

00:16:49.154 --> 00:16:51.824
He must be having a hard time
because his engagement has been postponed.

00:16:51.907 --> 00:16:53.075
He's quite irritable.

00:16:53.158 --> 00:16:54.118
Postponed?

00:16:54.201 --> 00:16:57.496
His mother collapsed
in the middle of the ceremony.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.624
We should lie low today.

00:17:00.707 --> 00:17:01.583
Yeah.

00:17:09.675 --> 00:17:12.344
This is the draft
of the invitation wording.

00:17:17.474 --> 00:17:18.600
May I ask

00:17:19.268 --> 00:17:21.645
if your mother is doing all right?

00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:28.068
I heard that your engagement ceremony
has been postponed.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.657
We're all concerned for you.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.201
Useless concern leads to such results.

00:17:36.785 --> 00:17:38.662
Pardon? Is it not good?

00:17:39.872 --> 00:17:41.540
That's putting it mildly.

00:17:44.835 --> 00:17:48.172
There isn't an ounce of sincerity
in these words.

00:17:50.507 --> 00:17:51.425
Redo it.

00:17:54.678 --> 00:17:56.430
I thought it was fine.

00:17:58.849 --> 00:17:59.725
Darn it.

00:18:05.022 --> 00:18:06.440
Is this better?

00:18:06.523 --> 00:18:07.357
Redo it.

00:18:19.536 --> 00:18:20.704
Redo it.

00:18:25.792 --> 00:18:27.544
THE DAY WE PLANTED TREES,
OUR EYES WERE ON OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.470
Thank you.

00:18:37.429 --> 00:18:38.263
Come on.

00:18:38.347 --> 00:18:39.389
Redo it.

00:18:40.724 --> 00:18:41.892
Let's redo it.

00:18:43.977 --> 00:18:44.811
GROWING WITH NATURE…

00:18:51.818 --> 00:18:53.737
It's so cliché. Redo it!

00:19:07.417 --> 00:19:09.378
Hello, Ms. Yu. How are you?

00:19:09.461 --> 00:19:10.295
Not good.

00:19:10.379 --> 00:19:11.713
Ji-hyeok is inside, right?

00:19:11.797 --> 00:19:13.298
There he is. Excuse me.

00:19:13.924 --> 00:19:14.758
Sure.

00:19:36.363 --> 00:19:37.489
They look good together.

00:19:41.868 --> 00:19:43.912
Before your mother collapsed yesterday,

00:19:43.996 --> 00:19:46.248
-I was trying to say--
-"I love someone else."

00:19:46.873 --> 00:19:48.000
"I can't marry him"?

00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:49.876
Don't get mad. I can explain.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.836
Yu Ha-yeong.

00:19:55.215 --> 00:19:56.466
How long have you known…

00:19:58.218 --> 00:20:00.721
that Kim Seon-u and Go Da-rim
aren't married?

00:20:01.763 --> 00:20:02.723
You know?

00:20:02.806 --> 00:20:04.057
When? How?

00:20:04.141 --> 00:20:05.851
Don't tell me Ms. Go told--

00:20:46.558 --> 00:20:47.517
Be quiet.

00:20:47.601 --> 00:20:49.436
Ms. Go doesn't know that I know yet.

00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:51.772
What? Then how did you find out?

00:20:51.855 --> 00:20:52.981
You don't need to know.

00:20:55.192 --> 00:20:56.777
Why have you kept this from me?

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.529
Because Mr. Kim asked me
to keep it a secret.

00:21:00.113 --> 00:21:01.823
Do you know how frustrating it was for me?

00:21:01.907 --> 00:21:04.242
I was treated like some mistress
for no reason.

00:21:04.993 --> 00:21:05.869
All right.

00:21:06.828 --> 00:21:08.163
We'll call off the wedding.

00:21:08.246 --> 00:21:10.123
You mean it? You can't take it back.

00:21:10.207 --> 00:21:11.541
I need to record this.

00:21:12.084 --> 00:21:13.293
But do me a favor.

00:21:14.628 --> 00:21:15.837
I need us to stay engaged

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.464
for the time being.

00:21:17.547 --> 00:21:18.507
What?

00:21:20.092 --> 00:21:22.386
Ms. Gong, we have an emergency.

00:21:23.136 --> 00:21:24.346
What now?

00:21:24.429 --> 00:21:28.725
Ms. Yu headed to the TF team office
looking super upset.

00:21:28.809 --> 00:21:31.978
What if she and Mr. Gong
barge into the chairman's office

00:21:32.062 --> 00:21:34.272
and set a date for their wedding?

00:21:34.898 --> 00:21:36.650
Damn it.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.862
I didn't know your mother
was going through that.

00:21:42.406 --> 00:21:46.493
I did think it was weird
that you suddenly joined the company

00:21:46.576 --> 00:21:47.994
and wanted to marry me.

00:21:48.078 --> 00:21:49.121
I'm sorry.

00:21:49.204 --> 00:21:51.748
It's fine.
It must've been tough for you as well.

00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:55.961
So I just need to stay quiet
for the time being, right?

00:21:56.044 --> 00:21:56.878
Yeah.

00:21:57.421 --> 00:21:58.380
Thanks.

00:21:58.463 --> 00:22:02.175
In exchange, you can't stop me
from pursuing Mr. Kim, okay?

00:22:02.759 --> 00:22:04.469
Do you like him that much?

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.138
Why?

00:22:08.265 --> 00:22:10.892
He's kind, sweet, thoughtful, and warm.

00:22:10.976 --> 00:22:12.727
He's just perfect.

00:22:13.603 --> 00:22:17.357
Well, except for the fact
that he likes Ms. Go and not me.

00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:19.151
But you still like him?

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.405
Even when he likes someone else?

00:22:23.488 --> 00:22:25.449
What a silly thing to say.

00:22:26.199 --> 00:22:30.495
It's such a blessing to be able to
love someone wholeheartedly.

00:22:30.579 --> 00:22:32.622
That doesn't happen often in life,
you know.

00:22:32.706 --> 00:22:35.709
So when it happens,
you can't let your pride stand in the way.

00:22:36.293 --> 00:22:37.377
Then what?

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:38.545
You should enjoy it.

00:22:39.129 --> 00:22:42.716
Enjoy yourself drowning in your feelings
for that person.

00:22:43.967 --> 00:22:45.218
You know what?

00:22:45.302 --> 00:22:47.929
Talking about him
is making me miss him so much.

00:22:48.013 --> 00:22:49.973
I'm off to see Mr. Kim. Bye.

00:23:07.991 --> 00:23:08.909
Ms. Go!

00:23:11.203 --> 00:23:12.954
Did your conversation go well?

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.248
Yes, very well.

00:23:18.043 --> 00:23:19.336
Speaking of which,

00:23:19.419 --> 00:23:20.462
I know everything.

00:23:20.545 --> 00:23:21.504
Sorry?

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.926
I know that you're single.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.890
Single?

00:23:37.103 --> 00:23:38.980
Why would Ms. Go be single?

00:23:41.858 --> 00:23:42.901
Ji-hye.

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:47.906
Ms. Gong.

00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:52.118
Single for me too.

00:23:56.289 --> 00:23:59.125
Ha-yeong offered to treat us
to some ice cream.

00:23:59.209 --> 00:24:00.627
Ms. Go

00:24:01.211 --> 00:24:03.546
asked for a single scoop as well, right?

00:24:04.631 --> 00:24:05.465
What?

00:24:06.675 --> 00:24:08.718
All right, then two single-scoop cones.

00:24:09.928 --> 00:24:11.054
Would you like one as well?

00:24:11.137 --> 00:24:12.430
No, I'm fine.

00:24:14.975 --> 00:24:15.850
Are you here to see Ji-hyeok?

00:24:16.434 --> 00:24:19.145
Yes. I thought I'd stop by,
considering what happened yesterday.

00:24:19.229 --> 00:24:20.063
I see.

00:24:21.398 --> 00:24:23.441
Father wants to see us right now.

00:24:25.235 --> 00:24:27.946
Oh, then I guess
we can't have ice cream together.

00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:29.864
Ms. Go, we can have some next time.

00:24:30.448 --> 00:24:31.491
Bye!

00:24:35.704 --> 00:24:37.247
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

00:24:52.554 --> 00:24:54.347
Engagement or wedding ceremony,

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.058
it doesn't matter to me.

00:24:58.184 --> 00:25:00.145
I'd just like Mom there.

00:25:01.021 --> 00:25:02.230
Please just wait

00:25:03.356 --> 00:25:04.566
until she recovers.

00:25:04.649 --> 00:25:06.985
-Who knows what trouble she'll cause?
-Father.

00:25:07.068 --> 00:25:09.529
I'm just worried Chairman Yu
will change his mind.

00:25:10.113 --> 00:25:12.365
Families are lining up
to claim Ha-yeong's hand.

00:25:13.658 --> 00:25:15.118
You don't need to worry about that.

00:25:15.201 --> 00:25:17.245
I'll be sure to accomplish enough
in the company

00:25:17.329 --> 00:25:19.164
to gain Chairman Yu's approval.

00:25:19.748 --> 00:25:21.666
Working here isn't so bad after all, huh?

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:22.584
No, it isn't.

00:25:22.667 --> 00:25:24.210
I'm surprisingly enjoying myself.

00:25:26.129 --> 00:25:27.547
I even started thinking

00:25:28.757 --> 00:25:29.591
about future plans.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.722
It looks like
he's finally come to his senses.

00:25:36.306 --> 00:25:38.391
I'll find you a proper position soon,

00:25:38.933 --> 00:25:39.809
so work hard.

00:25:51.821 --> 00:25:52.947
I know everything.

00:25:53.031 --> 00:25:54.949
I know that you're single.

00:26:10.757 --> 00:26:11.633
Ms. Go.

00:26:12.967 --> 00:26:14.344
Do you have anything to tell me?

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:16.304
Pardon?

00:26:23.395 --> 00:26:25.522
I thought I told you it lacked sincerity.

00:26:26.189 --> 00:26:27.982
I see no improvement.

00:26:28.066 --> 00:26:31.486
Well, I'm not much of a wordsmith,

00:26:32.153 --> 00:26:34.697
but I believe there was sincerity
in what I wrote.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.410
If you could specify
which part you find unsatisfactory--

00:26:38.493 --> 00:26:40.662
Do you not know what sincere means?

00:26:43.248 --> 00:26:45.291
A truthful and righteous heart.

00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:46.751
Then again,

00:26:48.378 --> 00:26:50.797
words only reflect the writer.

00:26:51.381 --> 00:26:55.260
Are you sure this is because
you don't like what I wrote?

00:26:56.636 --> 00:26:59.097
I feel like you may be upset with me
and not my words.

00:27:00.932 --> 00:27:04.686
May I ask you why you're upset with me?

00:27:14.821 --> 00:27:15.905
You're right.

00:27:15.989 --> 00:27:18.241
I am upset with you.

00:27:20.118 --> 00:27:21.536
What is it?

00:27:22.787 --> 00:27:23.621
Pardon?

00:27:23.705 --> 00:27:24.706
What could it be?

00:27:26.249 --> 00:27:27.375
Why would I be upset?

00:27:28.918 --> 00:27:31.045
I'm not sure.

00:27:31.129 --> 00:27:33.089
I believe you know.

00:27:33.173 --> 00:27:35.091
No, you must know.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.262
How could you not know
about a lie you made up?

00:27:44.684 --> 00:27:45.560
Who are you…

00:27:47.479 --> 00:27:48.646
really?

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.816
Are you really…

00:27:55.028 --> 00:27:55.987
Kim Seon-u's wife?

00:28:00.366 --> 00:28:01.534
Are you really…

00:28:03.411 --> 00:28:04.245
Kim Jun's mom?

00:28:13.129 --> 00:28:14.506
Welcome.

00:28:17.091 --> 00:28:18.384
Surprise!

00:28:18.968 --> 00:28:20.094
Did you miss me?

00:28:21.471 --> 00:28:22.472
Ta-da.

00:28:23.014 --> 00:28:24.474
What's this?

00:28:25.058 --> 00:28:25.892
I'm flirting.

00:28:28.645 --> 00:28:30.438
Surely you've heard
about my engagement being postponed.

00:28:30.939 --> 00:28:34.317
And it turns out Ji-hyeok already knew
that you two aren't married.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.485
He knows?

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.945
Mr. Gong?

00:28:37.737 --> 00:28:38.780
Yes.

00:28:38.863 --> 00:28:41.074
So we don't need to worry
about anything anymore.

00:28:42.116 --> 00:28:42.951
Don't try to stop me.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.080
What about Da-rim?
Does she know he knows? Is she okay?

00:28:47.163 --> 00:28:49.207
It's always about that darn Go Da-rim.

00:28:50.208 --> 00:28:51.668
Why should I care?

00:28:53.336 --> 00:28:54.587
Where's the vase?

00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:01.928
How could you do that?

00:29:02.011 --> 00:29:03.596
How could you pretend to be a mom
when you don't have a child?

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.973
This is just unbelievable.

00:29:05.056 --> 00:29:07.183
Give me back the hand cream I gave you.

00:29:07.267 --> 00:29:08.268
Give it!

00:29:08.351 --> 00:29:09.936
Come on, just move it along.

00:29:10.019 --> 00:29:12.272
Pack your stuff
and get out of here already,

00:29:12.355 --> 00:29:13.940
you damn con artist!

00:29:14.023 --> 00:29:15.108
I'm disappointed.

00:29:15.191 --> 00:29:17.151
I trusted and relied on you.

00:29:17.235 --> 00:29:19.153
How could you trust her?

00:29:19.237 --> 00:29:21.364
She's serious trouble.

00:29:21.447 --> 00:29:23.658
She's an expert at using people.

00:29:23.741 --> 00:29:26.911
She even tried to make something happen
with Mr. Gong.

00:29:27.829 --> 00:29:29.914
She was trying to score big.

00:29:32.166 --> 00:29:33.418
Da-rim, it's time to go home.

00:29:33.501 --> 00:29:34.460
Right.

00:29:34.544 --> 00:29:35.670
-Hurry up.
-Finally!

00:29:35.753 --> 00:29:37.338
-I'm heading out.
-It's time to go home.

00:29:37.422 --> 00:29:39.507
Let's go. Hurry up!

00:29:41.134 --> 00:29:42.218
I'm so tired.

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:07.035
Who are you…

00:30:08.912 --> 00:30:09.913
really?

00:30:17.003 --> 00:30:18.755
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

00:30:25.219 --> 00:30:26.429
Was it fun?

00:30:27.347 --> 00:30:28.389
Toying with me?

00:30:28.473 --> 00:30:30.683
No, not at all. I just--

00:30:30.767 --> 00:30:32.060
You'll be fired immediately.

00:30:32.143 --> 00:30:33.561
You may leave.

00:30:37.106 --> 00:30:38.900
Mr. Gong, I'm really sorry.

00:30:38.983 --> 00:30:39.901
The truth is--

00:30:39.984 --> 00:30:42.362
You just missed your chance
to tell me the truth. Please leave.

00:31:03.383 --> 00:31:05.051
Mom, I have something to tell--

00:31:05.134 --> 00:31:07.679
I have good news.

00:31:08.262 --> 00:31:09.138
What is it?

00:31:09.222 --> 00:31:12.266
The doctor said I can be discharged soon.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:14.560
We're going to set a date for next week.

00:31:15.144 --> 00:31:16.562
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:31:17.939 --> 00:31:20.900
I'll be able to sleep in my own bed soon.

00:31:20.984 --> 00:31:21.818
I can't wait.

00:31:24.612 --> 00:31:26.864
This is all thanks to you.

00:31:27.657 --> 00:31:28.658
I didn't do anything.

00:31:29.742 --> 00:31:32.662
All thanks to you landing a job
at that big company,

00:31:32.745 --> 00:31:33.871
we can afford the hospital bills

00:31:34.455 --> 00:31:37.041
and at least cover the interest
on the loan Da-jeong took out

00:31:37.125 --> 00:31:38.918
with the house as collateral.

00:31:39.002 --> 00:31:41.129
That's the only reason why
I'm able to go back home.

00:31:41.212 --> 00:31:43.715
If it weren't for you,
we'd be out in the streets.

00:31:43.798 --> 00:31:45.675
Who knows if I'd still be alive right now?

00:31:46.259 --> 00:31:48.761
Why would you even say that?

00:31:49.387 --> 00:31:51.639
I'm just thankful for everything.

00:31:52.849 --> 00:31:54.517
Thank you.

00:32:07.405 --> 00:32:11.951
TEAM MEMBER GO DA-RIM

00:32:29.218 --> 00:32:30.470
MISSED CALL
TEAM MEMBER GO DA-RIM

00:32:32.388 --> 00:32:33.473
TEAM MEMBER GO DA-RIM

00:32:33.556 --> 00:32:35.933
Mr. Gong, I'm in front of your place.

00:32:36.642 --> 00:32:38.394
Could you hear me out for a second?

00:32:39.562 --> 00:32:41.189
I just need a moment of your time.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.621
MESSAGE UNREAD

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.940
Thank you for making the time.

00:34:06.023 --> 00:34:07.817
Go on. Make your excuses.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.319
I'll at least hear you out.

00:34:21.247 --> 00:34:22.874
I spent my twenties

00:34:23.833 --> 00:34:26.335
repeatedly failing to find a job.

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:30.089
Then I ended up
going on my first trip to Jeju Island,

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:34.302
when I got a call
that my mom had collapsed.

00:34:35.261 --> 00:34:36.387
Jeju?

00:34:39.348 --> 00:34:40.224
You mean that day?

00:34:41.142 --> 00:34:42.059
Yes.

00:34:43.186 --> 00:34:45.146
That's why I left

00:34:45.855 --> 00:34:47.732
without even saying goodbye to you.

00:34:49.358 --> 00:34:51.569
I didn't know what to do.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.031
My younger sister left us with a huge debt
and disappeared.

00:34:55.823 --> 00:34:58.242
My mom's hospital bills
were piling up fast.

00:35:00.661 --> 00:35:02.788
We were on the verge of losing our house,

00:35:04.457 --> 00:35:06.542
and I needed a full-time job

00:35:07.168 --> 00:35:09.337
to even qualify for a loan
for office workers.

00:35:10.254 --> 00:35:13.633
But who would hire someone over 30
with no experience?

00:35:17.261 --> 00:35:19.263
That's when I saw

00:35:21.057 --> 00:35:23.142
the job posting from Natural BeBe.

00:35:28.147 --> 00:35:30.191
I knew it was wrong.

00:35:35.863 --> 00:35:37.114
But to me…

00:35:41.786 --> 00:35:44.121
it felt like a lifeline from heaven.

00:35:45.289 --> 00:35:47.083
That's why I sucked it up

00:35:48.626 --> 00:35:49.627
and came up…

00:35:52.505 --> 00:35:53.547
with such a lie.

00:35:55.132 --> 00:35:56.801
I get that you're in a tough situation,

00:35:58.636 --> 00:36:00.972
but not everyone
resorts to fraudulent employment.

00:36:01.055 --> 00:36:02.265
Yes, I know.

00:36:03.307 --> 00:36:07.770
I've also been losing sleep every night
because of the guilt.

00:36:09.522 --> 00:36:11.148
I'm really sorry.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.446
I know this is incredibly shameless…

00:36:23.244 --> 00:36:26.455
but could you give me a little more time?

00:36:27.873 --> 00:36:30.376
At least just until I find another job.

00:36:31.794 --> 00:36:32.670
Just…

00:36:34.297 --> 00:36:35.464
a little bit more.

00:36:38.009 --> 00:36:39.302
Just a bit more time.

00:36:40.553 --> 00:36:42.305
That's all I ask.

00:36:51.314 --> 00:36:52.648
Let me think about it.

00:36:54.275 --> 00:36:55.526
I'll consider my options.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.802
Da-rim.

00:37:29.602 --> 00:37:30.519
Seon-u.

00:37:33.356 --> 00:37:34.899
It's all over for me now.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:38.819
I heard.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.406
Mr. Gong knows everything.

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:44.492
I must be getting punished.

00:37:45.117 --> 00:37:47.119
You can find another job.

00:37:47.912 --> 00:37:49.455
You're not the same person anymore.

00:37:50.039 --> 00:37:51.916
You've changed a lot since this job.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.168
You've grown stronger and more courageous.

00:37:55.961 --> 00:37:58.881
Do you think he's disappointed in me?

00:38:01.634 --> 00:38:02.760
Don't worry too much.

00:38:04.303 --> 00:38:05.805
Just think of this
as a blessing in disguise.

00:38:06.972 --> 00:38:08.349
You've suffered enough.

00:38:12.645 --> 00:38:15.022
Keeping secrets and lying…

00:38:18.234 --> 00:38:19.652
is really stressful.

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:25.616
I'm sorry. I've only been
causing you trouble recently.

00:38:26.909 --> 00:38:27.868
No.

00:38:28.452 --> 00:38:29.412
Not that.

00:38:31.872 --> 00:38:34.166
I was keeping something from you
and lying about it.

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:35.626
From me?

00:38:36.502 --> 00:38:37.336
About what?

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:42.550
My feelings.

00:38:44.844 --> 00:38:46.387
I kept my feelings from you.

00:38:47.888 --> 00:38:48.764
What?

00:38:51.392 --> 00:38:52.893
I like you.

00:38:54.311 --> 00:38:56.021
Not as a friend or family

00:38:57.064 --> 00:38:58.023
but as a woman.

00:39:03.988 --> 00:39:04.905
What?

00:39:05.573 --> 00:39:08.117
We've been friends
and more or less family for over 20 years,

00:39:08.993 --> 00:39:11.287
and I feel bad that I have a child.

00:39:12.788 --> 00:39:15.458
I thought about it a lot because
I was worried things would get awkward.

00:39:16.792 --> 00:39:17.668
But…

00:39:18.502 --> 00:39:20.379
I don't think I can hide it anymore.

00:39:32.683 --> 00:39:34.810
I think I'll really regret it
if I lose you.

00:39:38.647 --> 00:39:39.940
Well…

00:39:40.024 --> 00:39:40.941
I…

00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:43.527
-You see, I--
-Da-rim.

00:39:43.611 --> 00:39:44.904
Yeah?

00:39:44.987 --> 00:39:46.739
Don't give me an answer now.

00:39:47.448 --> 00:39:49.033
You can tell me later.

00:39:50.493 --> 00:39:52.203
I want you to take
as much time as you need…

00:39:56.874 --> 00:39:59.043
and think about it seriously.

00:40:19.897 --> 00:40:21.941
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

00:40:24.026 --> 00:40:27.154
I got a call that my mom had collapsed.

00:40:27.238 --> 00:40:29.323
That's why I left

00:40:30.115 --> 00:40:31.909
without even saying goodbye to you.

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.620
My mom's hospital bills
were piling up fast.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.997
I knew it was wrong.

00:40:37.623 --> 00:40:40.251
But to me,
it felt like a lifeline from heaven.

00:40:41.418 --> 00:40:43.170
That's why I sucked it up

00:40:44.797 --> 00:40:45.798
and came up…

00:40:48.634 --> 00:40:49.468
with such a lie.

00:40:54.056 --> 00:40:58.352
It's such a blessing to be able to
love someone wholeheartedly.

00:40:58.435 --> 00:41:00.062
That doesn't happen often in life,
you know.

00:41:02.606 --> 00:41:04.441
Don't worry about anything else.

00:41:05.067 --> 00:41:07.611
Just focus on yourself

00:41:08.487 --> 00:41:10.531
and follow your heart.

00:42:13.636 --> 00:42:15.971
MOTHER TF TEAM
GO DA-RIM

00:42:26.857 --> 00:42:28.484
-Are you okay?
-I can do it.

00:42:28.567 --> 00:42:29.485
Let me help you.

00:42:30.861 --> 00:42:32.821
-Thank you.
-No problem.

00:42:53.509 --> 00:42:54.343
Are you okay?

00:42:54.426 --> 00:42:56.512
You should wait over there.

00:42:56.595 --> 00:42:58.180
-Thank you.
-Sure.

00:42:58.263 --> 00:42:59.890
Sorry. It'll just be a second.

00:43:00.516 --> 00:43:01.517
Grab that.

00:43:04.103 --> 00:43:05.521
Mischievous tangerines.

00:43:05.604 --> 00:43:07.064
-Yes, they are.
-Thank you so much.

00:43:07.147 --> 00:43:08.732
-No worries.
-Thank you.

00:43:30.921 --> 00:43:31.880
Oh no.

00:44:20.262 --> 00:44:21.263
Thank you.

00:44:37.696 --> 00:44:38.697
Good morning.

00:44:38.781 --> 00:44:40.532
Oh, you're up early.

00:44:40.616 --> 00:44:42.242
I'll prepare breakfast for you.

00:44:42.326 --> 00:44:43.243
Is that mail?

00:44:43.327 --> 00:44:45.537
Yes, it's addressed to Mr. Yu,

00:44:45.621 --> 00:44:46.997
but there's no sender information.

00:44:48.624 --> 00:44:49.458
Really?

00:44:49.958 --> 00:44:51.001
You can give it to me.

00:44:51.084 --> 00:44:52.336
I'll bring it to him.

00:44:52.419 --> 00:44:53.337
Okay.

00:44:57.591 --> 00:44:58.425
RECIPIENT: YU JIN-TAE

00:45:15.275 --> 00:45:18.529
You must be quite desperate,
resorting to such methods.

00:45:18.612 --> 00:45:19.446
What are you talking about?

00:45:20.197 --> 00:45:21.031
That wasn't me.

00:45:21.114 --> 00:45:22.950
Who else wants to stop this wedding?

00:45:24.034 --> 00:45:25.827
You can be honest with me.

00:45:25.911 --> 00:45:27.371
I'm the only one on your side right now.

00:45:28.705 --> 00:45:30.749
Actually, you have one more.
Mr. Ma Jong-gu, was it?

00:45:32.167 --> 00:45:33.418
Did he tell you that?

00:45:36.213 --> 00:45:39.216
I tried feeling him out earlier,
and he couldn't stop rambling.

00:45:39.299 --> 00:45:41.009
He basically confessed to it.

00:45:43.387 --> 00:45:44.846
Even your subordinate is just like you.

00:45:45.514 --> 00:45:48.141
I could see right through him.

00:45:51.103 --> 00:45:53.397
You should be thankful that I intercepted.

00:45:54.147 --> 00:45:55.691
Just imagine if my father saw this.

00:45:55.774 --> 00:45:58.193
He would've pushed up the wedding
to stop this from spreading.

00:45:59.987 --> 00:46:00.821
Push it up?

00:46:00.904 --> 00:46:03.198
With so much at stake,
you think he'd call it off over this?

00:46:04.074 --> 00:46:05.742
You're still so naive.

00:46:07.077 --> 00:46:08.078
That's why

00:46:08.745 --> 00:46:10.872
you need me.

00:46:14.293 --> 00:46:15.460
Got it, baby?

00:46:17.546 --> 00:46:19.006
You're so adorable.

00:46:22.634 --> 00:46:23.594
I'm off.

00:46:33.186 --> 00:46:35.981
Ms. Lee and I will cover the Gangbuk area.

00:46:36.064 --> 00:46:37.774
Can you cover the Gangnam area, Ms. Go?

00:46:37.858 --> 00:46:40.277
-Sure thing.
-With Mr. Gong.

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:43.071
I can go alone.

00:46:43.155 --> 00:46:45.532
Come on now, it's too much for one person.

00:46:45.616 --> 00:46:48.577
No, it's not too much at all.
Not even in the slightest.

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:53.415
I'm coming along to prevent you
from causing me any possible trouble.

00:46:53.498 --> 00:46:56.418
Who knows what kind of trouble
you'll get into wandering around?

00:46:57.836 --> 00:46:59.504
Cleaning up after you
would be more of a hassle.

00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:04.384
That damn mouth of his.

00:47:05.802 --> 00:47:06.678
Let's go.

00:47:14.645 --> 00:47:15.520
POSTERS

00:47:25.364 --> 00:47:26.823
You know how to drive, right?

00:47:27.407 --> 00:47:28.784
You want me to drive?

00:47:28.867 --> 00:47:30.661
I'm a bit tired. Do you not want to?

00:47:30.744 --> 00:47:33.121
No, it's just that I've barely driven
since getting my license.

00:47:37.459 --> 00:47:38.335
Yes, sir.

00:47:40.253 --> 00:47:41.296
Fine, whatever.

00:47:51.473 --> 00:47:52.391
Go Da-rim?

00:48:18.375 --> 00:48:19.626
A bicycle just passed us.

00:48:20.961 --> 00:48:22.713
Step on it a little, will you?

00:48:22.796 --> 00:48:23.839
More?

00:48:23.922 --> 00:48:25.298
Aren't we going fast enough?

00:48:27.926 --> 00:48:29.720
It's fine. Step on it.

00:48:29.803 --> 00:48:30.679
What?

00:48:30.762 --> 00:48:32.097
Step on it.

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.014
Okay.

00:48:36.727 --> 00:48:37.769
Stop, stop, stop!

00:48:50.449 --> 00:48:52.033
Have you lost your mind?

00:48:52.117 --> 00:48:53.201
You call that driving?

00:48:53.285 --> 00:48:56.747
It's been a while since I've driven,
and with you next to me,

00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:58.165
I got so nervous.

00:48:58.248 --> 00:48:59.916
I'm not chewing you up right now, am I?

00:49:00.751 --> 00:49:03.170
Who knows when you'll tell me to quit?

00:49:03.253 --> 00:49:04.671
I'm just anxious.

00:49:05.756 --> 00:49:08.925
You can relax. I won't let anyone
in the company know for the time being.

00:49:09.926 --> 00:49:10.969
Do you mean that?

00:49:11.052 --> 00:49:13.346
We have the campaign and the exhibition.

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:15.807
Do you know how much work you've started?

00:49:15.891 --> 00:49:17.684
You need to see them through
before you leave.

00:49:18.518 --> 00:49:19.978
We're short-staffed as it is.

00:49:21.021 --> 00:49:22.731
Thank you, Mr. Gong.

00:49:22.814 --> 00:49:24.900
So get your act together already!

00:49:25.442 --> 00:49:27.152
One slip, and you're fired.

00:49:27.736 --> 00:49:30.071
Okay, I'll get my act together.

00:49:30.155 --> 00:49:31.531
Go already.

00:49:32.157 --> 00:49:33.200
Okay.

00:49:33.283 --> 00:49:34.826
Slow down!

00:49:39.748 --> 00:49:42.000
-The right side is higher.
-Oh, is it?

00:49:42.083 --> 00:49:43.043
Then…

00:49:43.126 --> 00:49:45.629
Come on. The left side is higher now.

00:49:46.296 --> 00:49:48.298
It's not leveled at all. Jeez.

00:49:49.174 --> 00:49:50.300
Oh gosh.

00:49:51.718 --> 00:49:53.929
How is it so hard to get this right?

00:49:54.554 --> 00:49:55.472
Excuse me.

00:49:55.555 --> 00:49:57.140
Press down slowly.

00:49:58.266 --> 00:50:00.477
-And slowly press down here.
-Right.

00:50:04.189 --> 00:50:05.315
Just stay here for a bit.

00:50:07.651 --> 00:50:10.070
Mr. Gong, I don't think we should be--

00:50:10.153 --> 00:50:10.987
Stay still.

00:50:12.197 --> 00:50:13.865
I know I'm single,

00:50:13.949 --> 00:50:16.618
and we did have
something along the lines of a fling,

00:50:16.701 --> 00:50:19.663
but we shouldn't hold hands like this
with you behind me…

00:50:19.746 --> 00:50:20.705
-Just a second.
-Sure.

00:50:21.998 --> 00:50:23.416
Press down on this.

00:50:24.084 --> 00:50:25.752
And here as well.

00:50:31.091 --> 00:50:32.467
Is it still a bit crooked?

00:50:36.513 --> 00:50:37.472
That should do.

00:50:41.768 --> 00:50:43.186
What did you just say?

00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:45.689
Oh, nothing.

00:50:45.772 --> 00:50:47.732
It was nothing.

00:50:47.816 --> 00:50:50.318
You have an excellent sense of balance.

00:50:50.402 --> 00:50:51.945
As expected of you, sir.

00:51:02.998 --> 00:51:03.874
A lawsuit?

00:51:03.957 --> 00:51:05.375
My word.

00:51:06.209 --> 00:51:08.044
You made a big decision.

00:51:08.128 --> 00:51:09.212
It's all thanks to you.

00:51:10.922 --> 00:51:12.716
I've reflected a lot.

00:51:12.799 --> 00:51:14.426
I didn't do anything.

00:51:14.509 --> 00:51:15.969
You told me when a mom falls apart,

00:51:16.052 --> 00:51:19.097
the child's whole world crumbles.

00:51:19.806 --> 00:51:23.018
That's why I decided
I should become stronger now.

00:51:23.518 --> 00:51:26.313
I'm glad to see you with some spark.

00:51:27.606 --> 00:51:29.900
How am I ever going to
leave this frail lady behind

00:51:29.983 --> 00:51:31.484
and go home by myself?

00:51:32.736 --> 00:51:33.737
You're being discharged?

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:35.488
Yes, in a few days.

00:51:35.572 --> 00:51:38.617
Your cast should be coming off
any day now, no?

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.243
Yes.

00:51:40.327 --> 00:51:41.786
It should be.

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:47.500
I'm not sure where I should go
after being discharged.

00:51:48.084 --> 00:51:50.462
I have a lot to handle
without my husband knowing.

00:51:50.545 --> 00:51:53.048
If I go back to the psychiatric hospital,

00:51:53.131 --> 00:51:55.508
I'll be surrounded by my husband's people.

00:51:56.134 --> 00:51:58.970
If I stay at a hotel,
I'm bound to draw attention

00:51:59.596 --> 00:52:01.348
with the attorneys coming in and out.

00:52:05.352 --> 00:52:06.728
What about my place?

00:52:07.896 --> 00:52:08.730
Pardon?

00:52:08.813 --> 00:52:10.440
My younger daughter's room is free.

00:52:10.523 --> 00:52:13.818
Just tell your husband
you're going on a trip far away.

00:52:15.695 --> 00:52:17.364
I appreciate it, but…

00:52:18.323 --> 00:52:20.116
Are you sure?

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.785
I don't want to inconvenience you.

00:52:21.868 --> 00:52:25.997
I'd be home alone all day
after my daughter goes to work anyway.

00:52:26.081 --> 00:52:27.916
It'd be nice to have a friend to talk to.

00:52:27.999 --> 00:52:31.127
Don't worry about a thing,
and just think of it as your home.

00:52:32.963 --> 00:52:33.880
It's going to be fun.

00:52:37.676 --> 00:52:38.551
Hello.

00:52:49.479 --> 00:52:51.272
I thought they were only interviewing
the photographer,

00:52:52.065 --> 00:52:53.191
but here you are, Mr. Gong.

00:52:54.317 --> 00:52:55.443
I know, right?

00:52:55.527 --> 00:52:57.654
They asked for the team leader
who organized the exhibition

00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:00.448
or a representative
from the hosting organization.

00:53:01.658 --> 00:53:02.867
And that happens to be me.

00:53:03.451 --> 00:53:04.285
I see.

00:53:04.953 --> 00:53:07.247
You're really studying that script.

00:53:08.039 --> 00:53:09.290
You're a great actor already.

00:53:10.458 --> 00:53:12.168
Oh, it's a compliment.

00:53:12.252 --> 00:53:14.254
You really have a knack for it.

00:53:14.879 --> 00:53:16.297
I was totally fooled

00:53:17.215 --> 00:53:18.758
and believed you were her husband.

00:53:24.014 --> 00:53:24.973
I'm sorry.

00:53:25.932 --> 00:53:28.226
I've actually been meaning
to apologize to you.

00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:30.603
Da-rim was in such a tough situation,

00:53:30.687 --> 00:53:33.982
and I made the wrong choice
because I wanted to help in any way.

00:53:36.359 --> 00:53:39.070
I've been made aware
of her family situation,

00:53:40.113 --> 00:53:41.865
but the company won't care about that.

00:53:43.241 --> 00:53:44.784
She'll be fired soon.

00:53:45.785 --> 00:53:46.661
Right.

00:53:47.704 --> 00:53:50.081
Of course, she would be, but it's okay.

00:53:51.291 --> 00:53:52.417
I'll be taking care of Da-rim…

00:53:54.002 --> 00:53:55.420
from now on.

00:54:03.845 --> 00:54:05.930
And who are you to do that?

00:54:07.599 --> 00:54:10.393
The person who knows her the best…

00:54:13.229 --> 00:54:14.689
and worries about her the most.

00:54:22.655 --> 00:54:23.782
We're ready for you now.

00:54:23.865 --> 00:54:25.617
-Please follow me.
-Okay.

00:54:30.288 --> 00:54:33.249
The theme for this exhibition is "growth."

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:35.376
Is there a special meaning behind that?

00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:36.544
Yes, there is.

00:54:36.628 --> 00:54:40.507
Growth doesn't just mean
to grow physically,

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:44.677
but also to change and transform
for the better.

00:54:45.303 --> 00:54:47.305
So through this exhibition,

00:54:47.388 --> 00:54:49.140
I wanted to relay the message

00:54:49.724 --> 00:54:53.812
of making a better world
for the family I love.

00:54:53.895 --> 00:54:55.438
Oh my, that's lovely.

00:54:56.856 --> 00:54:57.774
Thank you.

00:54:59.818 --> 00:55:02.153
-Great.
-Oh gosh!

00:55:03.154 --> 00:55:04.989
Oh no, what a mess.

00:55:05.073 --> 00:55:06.199
My hand just slipped.

00:55:08.535 --> 00:55:09.702
Sorry.

00:55:11.704 --> 00:55:12.539
Right.

00:55:12.622 --> 00:55:14.374
I'm fine. Please continue.

00:55:14.457 --> 00:55:18.586
Then shall we move on
to a question for Mr. Gong?

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:20.421
You took on this major campaign

00:55:20.505 --> 00:55:24.217
with a team of entry-level employees
as soon as you joined the company.

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:26.886
Did you feel any pressure?

00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:28.179
I'm not sure.

00:55:28.263 --> 00:55:30.390
Compared to the scale
of corporate M&As I used to handle,

00:55:30.473 --> 00:55:32.267
this is a very small-scale event,

00:55:32.350 --> 00:55:33.977
so I didn't feel any pressure.

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:37.105
I'm also very much enjoying
working with my team members.

00:55:38.731 --> 00:55:39.816
That woman over there

00:55:39.899 --> 00:55:41.985
is the one who came up with the idea
for this campaign.

00:55:42.068 --> 00:55:43.945
We work great together,

00:55:44.571 --> 00:55:46.865
and she's someone
who faithfully follows my lead.

00:55:47.574 --> 00:55:49.659
Ms. Go Da-rim.

00:55:56.457 --> 00:55:58.751
I'm sorry,
I was reaching for the rice cakes.

00:56:00.253 --> 00:56:01.129
Wow.

00:56:02.755 --> 00:56:03.965
Something's in the air today.

00:56:04.048 --> 00:56:05.466
I'm sorry.

00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:06.885
It's fine.

00:56:08.094 --> 00:56:09.137
It was an accident.

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:10.513
Right, so…

00:56:10.597 --> 00:56:14.225
Then how about we have

00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:17.896
Ms. Go Da-rim join us for a chat?

00:56:23.234 --> 00:56:24.110
Me?

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:30.825
Why do you believe
this campaign has garnered

00:56:30.909 --> 00:56:32.327
such a positive public response?

00:56:35.496 --> 00:56:39.709
Environmental issues are something
everyone experiences firsthand.

00:56:40.418 --> 00:56:41.836
And I believe

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:46.799
Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok's
long-standing principle

00:56:47.842 --> 00:56:50.511
of upholding
corporate social responsibility

00:56:50.595 --> 00:56:54.307
may have resonated well
with the consumers.

00:56:55.183 --> 00:56:56.851
My goodness.

00:56:56.935 --> 00:56:58.853
I wasn't trying to make
my principles so obvious,

00:56:59.354 --> 00:57:00.480
but I guess I failed.

00:57:03.066 --> 00:57:03.900
Oh dear.

00:57:07.237 --> 00:57:09.405
I also believe Mr. Kim Seon-u's

00:57:09.489 --> 00:57:13.868
artistic and heartfelt photos

00:57:13.952 --> 00:57:16.788
really resonated with a lot of people.

00:57:17.455 --> 00:57:18.831
Even with principles,

00:57:18.915 --> 00:57:21.543
how you present them is what matters.

00:57:22.168 --> 00:57:23.378
Simply talking about them

00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:25.338
won't get the message across.

00:57:29.842 --> 00:57:33.137
Yes, of course.
Thank you for your insight.

00:57:33.721 --> 00:57:35.974
I think we can end the interview here.

00:57:36.057 --> 00:57:38.935
We'll just take a few more shots
of you two to use as the main photo.

00:57:39.519 --> 00:57:40.353
Sure.

00:57:48.611 --> 00:57:49.946
You're too far apart.

00:57:50.029 --> 00:57:51.489
Can you come to the center?

00:57:58.746 --> 00:57:59.831
That's great.

00:57:59.914 --> 00:58:01.749
Why don't we try a handshake?

00:58:30.236 --> 00:58:32.238
Yes, that's great. Please look this way.

00:58:32.322 --> 00:58:33.865
Now, give us a smile.

00:58:33.948 --> 00:58:35.533
Smile.

00:58:52.175 --> 00:58:54.177
Great job today. You must be tired.

00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:55.219
It was nothing.

00:58:55.303 --> 00:58:56.512
You're done, right?

00:58:56.596 --> 00:58:57.805
Let's have dinner together.

00:58:58.723 --> 00:59:01.976
I actually have some work to catch up on.

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:05.146
I saw the others go home earlier.
You're working by yourself?

00:59:05.855 --> 00:59:08.274
Yeah, well, the thing is…

00:59:09.108 --> 00:59:11.069
You also need to pick up Jun.

00:59:11.152 --> 00:59:12.945
He's away at camp.

00:59:16.991 --> 00:59:17.909
Hang on.

00:59:17.992 --> 00:59:19.535
Are you acting like this
because I said I liked you?

00:59:23.665 --> 00:59:25.249
Come on.

00:59:25.333 --> 00:59:26.876
This is how you're reacting to it?

00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.003
Are you sure you're the Go Da-rim I know?

00:59:29.671 --> 00:59:31.631
Hey, you're the weird one.

00:59:31.714 --> 00:59:34.634
How could you be perfectly fine
after saying all that?

00:59:34.717 --> 00:59:36.719
I wouldn't say I'm perfectly fine.

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.222
I'm just used to the butterflies.

00:59:39.806 --> 00:59:40.682
What?

00:59:43.267 --> 00:59:45.645
I'll wait for you downstairs.
Come down when you're ready.

00:59:48.898 --> 00:59:50.024
Okay, I'll be there soon.

01:00:04.539 --> 01:00:05.373
Ms. Go.

01:00:06.666 --> 01:00:07.792
Can I see you in my office?

01:00:11.879 --> 01:00:12.714
Sure.

01:00:16.801 --> 01:00:18.636
Did we send out all the invitations
for the exhibition?

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.138
We finished that earlier in the afternoon.

01:00:21.139 --> 01:00:22.473
Then what about the social media event?

01:00:22.557 --> 01:00:24.934
We compiled a list of the winners'
IDs and addresses

01:00:25.017 --> 01:00:26.602
and handed it over to the marketing team.

01:00:26.686 --> 01:00:27.770
-You did?
-Yes.

01:00:29.063 --> 01:00:30.314
I see.

01:00:31.649 --> 01:00:33.067
Are the pamphlets printed?

01:00:33.151 --> 01:00:34.235
They need to be checked thoroughly.

01:00:34.318 --> 01:00:35.737
They should arrive tomorrow,

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:37.947
so I'll be sure to check them thoroughly
when they do.

01:00:39.824 --> 01:00:40.825
Okay.

01:00:41.492 --> 01:00:42.452
What else is there?

01:00:43.453 --> 01:00:46.122
Is that everything?
Let's see here. Hold on.

01:00:53.212 --> 01:00:54.338
SEON-U

01:01:03.181 --> 01:01:04.682
I'll be taking care of Da-rim…

01:01:06.184 --> 01:01:07.643
from now on.

01:01:13.691 --> 01:01:16.819
I'll get going then.

01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:37.673
Let's have a meal.

01:01:38.966 --> 01:01:39.842
You and me.

01:01:44.639 --> 01:01:46.766
I already have plans.

01:01:46.849 --> 01:01:47.975
Cancel them.

01:01:49.769 --> 01:01:50.603
And stay with me.

01:01:53.815 --> 01:01:54.690
Don't go.

01:01:58.653 --> 01:01:59.695
I don't want you to go.

01:02:16.087 --> 01:02:21.008
DYNAMITE KISS

01:02:51.122 --> 01:02:52.999
You can't do this.

01:02:53.583 --> 01:02:54.750
What about Ms. Yu?

01:02:54.834 --> 01:02:57.211
Our families
are just pushing us to be together.

01:02:57.295 --> 01:02:58.754
I saw him being all lovey-dovey
with his fiancée.

01:02:58.838 --> 01:03:00.631
Why would he lie about that?

01:03:00.715 --> 01:03:02.842
Was I mistaken?

01:03:02.925 --> 01:03:04.886
You care deeply for other people.

01:03:04.969 --> 01:03:06.512
That's why I like you.

01:03:06.596 --> 01:03:10.182
-You take action. That's why I like you.
-Is this a new form of bullying?

01:03:10.266 --> 01:03:12.768
You said I had no reason to like you.

01:03:12.852 --> 01:03:14.103
That's why I'm stating them.

01:03:14.186 --> 01:03:16.397
Is there a way to tell

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.608
whether they're being genuine or not?

01:03:18.691 --> 01:03:19.775
You just come to realize it.

01:03:19.859 --> 01:03:22.862
"He likes me."

01:03:22.945 --> 01:03:27.825
