[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.930
[Episode 33]

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.370
Have you figured it out?

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.680
No, I haven't.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.960
Then go back and keep kneeling.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.760
Father.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.760
If you

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.870
don't make this clear

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.590
to me today,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.940
I won't yield,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
no matter how long you make me kneel.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.480
You're demanding an explanation from me?

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.710
I told you to keep an eye on
the salt fields in Lianghuai,

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.970
but what have you done?

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.350
Once you hand the salt fields over to me,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.060
I should get to call the shots.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.240
If anything happens,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.680
I'll deal with it on the spot.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.000
You shouldn't interfere.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.710
Wasn't that what we agreed upon

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.280
before I left?

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.160
So why are you pulling this on me again?

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.700
You have to be the wisest in the world

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.360
and do everything yourself, is that it?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.360
Then why did you send me there at all?

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.520
Then you tell me—

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.720
what have you accomplished in Nanjing?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.400
-That Viceroy...
-He wants to restore the economy of

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.079
the Lianghuai region, so he won't

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.470
hand over the salt fields—
his golden goose—

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.070
so easily.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.260
Everyone is asking him for money.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.510
He won't cooperate, and what did you do?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.080
Have you racked your brain

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.210
trying to figure out

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.910
how to persuade him

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.510
to hand over the salt fields?

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.390
You let others

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.330
lead you by the nose in everything.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.360
When they tell you to print books,
you do it.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.280
When they tell you to repair
the coastal embankment, you repair it.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.410
And the salt fields?

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.560
I've strained my eyes

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.560
until they're bloodshot,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.760
and I still don't see any progress, son.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.460
And another thing—

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.150
you and Gu Pingyuan

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.870
have teamed up

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.880
to offend Yang Ten-Million.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.280
Fine, offend him if you must,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.610
but why did you have to
keep bringing it up?

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.870
You shouldn't have humiliated him
like that.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.430
Father.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.030
That Yang Ten-Million is
a crooked merchant.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.710
He preys on the common people!

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.360
Honestly speaking,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.420
you're neglecting your real duties.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.750
I don't want to waste time
arguing with you.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.870
I can't outwit

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.360
the Viceroy of Liangjiang.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.870
If you want to fight, go do it yourself.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.710
But aside from that,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.710
I believe

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.960
I did nothing wrong.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.630
Gu Pingyuan—

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.380
you think he's someone easy to deal with?

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.750
The Viceroy of Liangjiang
pulled some strings with an official

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.560
from the Ministry of Rites to get him

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.090
an Associate Jinshi title.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.190
From now on, when you meet him—a Jinshi—

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.630
no matter how big a merchant you are,

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.430
you must kneel and kowtow to him!

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.800
See?

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.240
Elevate one while crushing the other—

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.370
look at his tactics.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.850
It's one thing
if you can't see through this,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:31.750
but you're still

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.270
sticking your neck out.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.950
Father, that's impossible.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.070
He's just a convict.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.159
At most, they'd restore
his household registry.

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.750
How could he possibly

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.080
be given Jinshi status?

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.159
Changing someone's credentials
isn't that difficult.

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:44.290
What's the big deal?

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.380
And I'll tell you straight—

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.560
I bought

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.240
an official post for Gu Pingyuan.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.430
The Viceroy of Liangjiang

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.800
used his connections and got it done.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.310
Father.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.680
Have you lost your mind?

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.270
Well...

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.659
Why would you spend money on that?

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.610
To send him away.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.600
He can take up his post
somewhere far from here.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.920
It's better if you two never see

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.920
each other again.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.310
So I won't have to worry every day

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.630
about him poisoning your mind.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.510
The two of us, father and son,

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.350
should work together properly

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.890
to deal with that Viceroy.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.000
So the Viceroy can't

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.560
keep using Gu Pingyuan against us.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.830
I don't understand at all.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.230
It doesn't matter if you don't understand.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.360
Leave Gu Pingyuan to handle
the coastal embankment repair work.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.360
You just stay at home
and attend to things here.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.000
Once we secure the salt fields,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.660
I'll put you in charge of them.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.320
Be good and do as I say, child.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.630
Kowtow to your father.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.560
When he left for the capital back then,

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.480
we never heard from him again—

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.560
[Memorial Tablet of Gu Wanzhang]

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.160
whether he was alive or dead.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.960
You were still little then.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.470
I was still pregnant with your brother.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:08.720
And he just

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.270
left and never returned.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.750
Some said he was still alive.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.730
Others said he died of illness.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.570
You've been thinking about him
all this time.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.780
I actually hope he's still alive.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.310
If he's alive,

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.630
I'd be happy even if he never comes back.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.720
It's better than being weighed down

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.720
by this uncertainty about
whether he's alive or dead.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:41.480
Then, I...

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.800
Kowtow now.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.680
I know your father.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.830
[Memorial Tablet of Gu Wanzhang]

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.960
As long as there's still breath in him,

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.190
he'll crawl back if he has to.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.950
[Memorial Tablet of Gu Wanzhang]

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.800
As for me...

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.160
I just assume he's already dead.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.980
[Memorial Tablet of Gu Wanzhang]

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.800
At that time,

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.520
someone was delivering tea to the capital

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.070
and met someone on the road

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.130
who looked exactly like your father.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.100
So they called out to him.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.770
Your father responded

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.760
and even turned around.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.090
But then he flatly denied it.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.320
The villager wouldn't let it go
just like that.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.909
They grabbed his sleeve,

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.950
and after some tugging and pulling,

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.120
they came to a fortune-teller's stall.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.720
The man borrowed a brush,

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.750
wrote something on a piece of paper,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.360
and asked the villager to bring it back.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.280
The villager couldn't read,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.780
and as soon as they took the paper,

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.600
the man seized the opportunity
to run away.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.800
So the villager brought the paper back.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.380
Such beautiful handwriting.

Mother,

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:43.840
this poem...

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.630
Mr. Bai read it

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.250
and said it was a ghost poem.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.080
A ghost poem?

If that isn't a ghost speaking, what is?

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:01.490
After Mr. Bai read this poem,

I never even knew

such a thing had happened.

You left.

We were separated

for so many years.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.360
If you ask me...

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.120
we should just stay home peacefully

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.840

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.170
Wifey,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.390
my mother lectured me again.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.870
My mind is in such turmoil.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.520
What's wrong?

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.270
Are you not feeling well?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:26.910
No.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.180
This time, no matter what,

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.070
you must help me make a decision.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.250
Just tell me,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.000
should I take
the official position or not?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.390
You're not one to chase after
official positions.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.670
Whether to take it or not—

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.730
don't you already know in your heart?

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.960
I really don't know,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.620
and that's why I'm asking you.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.000
Come here, let me hold you.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.060
Don't come near me.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.200
Just a hug.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.910
Wifey, I'm so tired.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:02.790
See?

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.630
I warned you.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.360
Gentlemen.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.160
We can talk things through.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.230
Please don't hurt my family.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.630
Master Gu.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.670
We've come to congratulate you.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.160
Why are you so afraid?

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.870
Oh, it's you, Ms. Su.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.190
I trust you've been well.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.670
Tell your man to lower his blade.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.220
If my family gets hurt,

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.550
don't blame me for losing my temper.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.200
You two really are a loving couple.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.080
I've brought you an old acquaintance.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.120
I wonder if you're willing to meet her.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.030
An old acquaintance?

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.360
What old acquaintance?

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.510
Yimei.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.510
Bai...

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:05.600
Bai Yimei?

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:14.870
Gu,

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.360
Chang,

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.870
I apologize for the offense.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.670
I offer my sincerest apologies.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.500
Yimei,

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.210
what are you doing?

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:28.870
I beg you to save

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.000
thousands of my men.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.530
They were all my late husband's soldiers.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.240
If you could lend a hand,

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.420
I would be eternally grateful

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.020
and repay your kindness
in every possible way.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.120
Ms. Su is so capable.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.320
Why don't you ask her?

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.600
If even she can't help,

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.330
then I certainly can't either.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.330
Besides,

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.520
thousands of men?

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.080
Where did you get thousands of men from?

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.440
Those thousands of prisoners of war

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.030
that Jiu sent to your construction site.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.390
They were General Li Cheng's

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.550
loyal comrades.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.520
They were captured after Nanjing fell.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.030
Jiu has been keeping them alive.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.390
He doesn't want to
waste food on them anymore

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.840
and fears public criticism
if he kills them.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.030
He's afraid the history books

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.240
will record him as someone
who killed prisoners.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.200
That old fox

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.550
never takes a loss.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.240
Once those men finish repairing
the coastal embankment,

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.480
they'll no longer be of any use.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.410
Marshal Jiu will surely kill them.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.630
Later,

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.000
he'll just claim they died

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.530
at your construction site.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.450
Those men can't die like that.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.160
If they do, when I die,

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.510
I won't be able to face him.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:30.960
Yeah,

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.110
you can't face him like that.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.480
Let's set aside whether we can rescue

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.880
those thousands for now.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.490
Let's say you do save them—

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.150
where would you settle them?

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.550
Don't tell me you want to be
a local warlord,

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.810
planning a rebellion.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.080
You don't need to concern yourself with

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.030
how these people will be sent out.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.030
All you need to do

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.670
is rescue them.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.240
Ms. Su, you are so resourceful.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.470
Why don't you teach me

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.660
how to rescue them?

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.610
Two firearms units

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.960
with rows of Western muskets.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.720
They're watching those thousands of men

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.050
without even blinking.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.240
I'm barehanded.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.390
I-I'm a scholar—utterly defenseless.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.670
I'm not the Monkey King.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.070
You think I can use magic?

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.240
Wifey,

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.670
do I look like the Monkey King to you?

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.930
You look like a tea farmer.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.030
Chang,

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.480
I can't just sit by and watch those men

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.880
being tortured to death.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.720
I simply cannot bear it.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.400
Please, I'm begging you to help me too.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.840
You... Please.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.360
Get up.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.240
You...

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:35.240
Ms. Bai,

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.630
will those thousands of men

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.200
really die?

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.670
They really will.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.200
They were all Li Cheng's former soldiers.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.840
Before they became soldiers,

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.100
they were just farmers

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.320
and merchants.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:50.240
Well...

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.550
Aren't they just ordinary people then?

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.200
Exactly.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:55.910
Then I...

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.970
Alright, alright.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.560
Let's stop here.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.720
Yimei,

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.670
I'm afraid we can't help you

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:01.750
with this favor.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.080
Please understand.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.000
We really can't help.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.200
There's more.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:07.670
I've rented boats

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:09.720
to take them away

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.410
and send them back home.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.320
You'd be that kind-hearted?

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.810
You, sending these people home?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.750
More likely you'll ship them off
somewhere else

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:20.600
and round them up again

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.120
to start another rebellion.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.320
When the imperial court investigates,

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.320
my ancestors' graves will be dug up

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.080
before I even know what's happening.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.940
Well, you can't

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.090
fool your partners.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.000
As long as you can
get those people onto the boats,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.720
I'll arrange everything properly.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.390
Those who want to farm can farm,

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.120
and those who want to do business
will get capital.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.000
This war

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.200
has claimed enough lives already.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.080
To rescue thousands of people

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.390
in front of two firearms units,

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.150
without giving Jiu

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:49.410
any excuse to catch us—

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.250
that's simply impossible.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.790
Do those prisoners

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.550
know they're going to be killed?

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:56.550
Of course they do.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:01.510
Ms. Su spending money to save people
is a noble act.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:02.910
You know better than I do.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:04.550
Now,

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.600
if the prisoners know they'll be killed

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.200
and cause trouble on the way,

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.240
we'll lose our heads all the same.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.120
I think...

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.120
you must do it.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:14.790
-You...
-Chang.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.200
You're right.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.260
Madam Gu sees things clearly.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.670
-Wifey...
-Hurry. Get up.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.410
D-Don't kneel anymore.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:26.990
Thank you.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.720
Come on, man,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:37.960
cut me.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.800
My head really hurts.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.380
Guys, please rise!

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.120
-My Lord.
-Those rebels—

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.390
are they working efficiently?

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.840
At first, they were lazy and slacking off.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.360
We picked out a few

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.390
and beat them half to death.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.750
Now they're much more obedient.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:56.880
Let's go take a look!

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.510
How's their food?

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.510
Well, no complaints.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.510
Better than what they got in prison.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.270
Is that so?

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:14.730
Don't pocket too much silver.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:17.170
After all, we still need them to work.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.440
We wouldn't dare.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.000
What's this?

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.369
My Lord, this is vegetable porridge.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:35.950
Is this meat?

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.160
This is a worm from the vegetables.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.960
How could we give them real meat?

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.660
You can't be like this!

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.160
They're doing heavy labor every day—

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.690
and you feed them just this?

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.640
They won't have any strength, you know?

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.160
My Lord,

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:52.750
if they had any more strength,

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:53.750
they would rebel.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.720
This humble servant remembers
your lordship's instructions.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.590
Keeping these people alive

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.680
is just trouble anyway.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.480
Feed them less and beat them more—

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.070
in just a few months,

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.680
half of them will be worn down to death.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.740
Do this gradually,

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.770
and they won't even resist.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.550
Come on, let's go. Turn around.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.680
You're quite sharp.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:11.840
Come back!

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.060
Put it down.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.500
What are you carrying?

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:27.720
Sir,

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.160
while we were constructing
the coastal embankment just now,

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.560
we found two jars of gold.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:32.880
We were just trying to find a chance

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.280
to bring them over to you.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:35.720
Two jars of gold?

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.260
What are you doing?

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.000
Stop right there!

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.600
Don't run!

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.880
No, no, no!

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.070
One missed shot,

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.560
and I'm as good as dead!

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.440
Surround them!

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.000
Hurry!

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.680
Quick! Quick! Quick!

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:31.830
You bastards!

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.640
Don't you dare...

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.550
Let me...

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.160
out!

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.570
Please, let me out!

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.140
Stay still!

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.840
Or I'll stab you to death!

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.110
Mr. Gu!

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.880
Mr. Gu!

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.480
What's wrong?

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.160
Something's happened
at the coastal embankment.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:56.960
Something...

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.680
something terrible has happened!

00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.720
What terrible thing has happened?

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.580
Marshal Jiu...

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.130
has been captured by those rebels.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:05.000
Nonsense!

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.880
Marshal Jiu is a legendary hero.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.160
How could he be captured so easily?

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.640
How would I know?

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.560
Marshal Jiu is a titled lord.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.070
If anything happens to him

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.030
in my jurisdiction,

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.640
I can't bear that responsibility.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.960
Please come with me to check it out.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.960
This is terrible!

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.160
My family is making braised ribs today!

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.350
Let's have a bite first,

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.550
then I'll go with you.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.200
You still think about ribs?

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.750
If anything happens to Marshal Jiu,

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:30.040
they'll tie me up at Caishikou
and flay me alive.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.920
I'll be the ribs then!

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:33.260
You know?

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.830
Just come with me!

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.200
Release Marshal Jiu now!

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.530
Let Marshal Jiu go!

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:43.680
Release him now!

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.720
Release Marshal Jiu immediately!

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.790
Let Marshal Jiu go!

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.750
Release him!

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.010
-Hurry, hurry!
-Hurry!

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.350
Mr. Gu!

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.440
Come on.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.070
Duck!

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.550
Hurry!

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:14.310
Mr. Gu,

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.730
we can't go any further.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:16.590
Stray bullets are flying!

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:17.450
What happened?

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:18.970
How could this happen?

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:20.260
They tricked Marshal Jiu

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.310
by claiming they'd dug up gold.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.350
Marshal Jiu was off his guard,

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.310
and they got him into a large barrel

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.270
and carried him away!

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.750
Got him into a large barrel?

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.880
What kind of barrel?

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.430
Well...

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.200
I'm asking you, what kind of barrel?

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.000
A rice barrel!

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:31.040
A rice barrel?

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:34.830
Heizi!

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:35.440
Be careful!

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.510
Over here! Here! Over here!

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:37.720
I was only gone for one day.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.660
How did such a major incident happen?

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.060
Where did you get the hat?

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.750
Marshal Jiu gave it to me.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:43.490
He said,

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:44.120
"Heizi,

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.620
you're really something.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.440
Why not stay here

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.680
and serve as a battalion commander
or higher,

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.310
earning glory with your sword and gun?"

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.160
I haven't even had the chance

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.160
to thank him yet...

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:51.960
I'm not joking with you!

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.680
Be serious!

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.440
What do they want?

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.830
They want to get out of here, of course.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:58.690
Get out of here?

00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.310
They're locked

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.750
underground all day with no human dignity.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.070
They'll die sooner or later anyway.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.890
Then they said

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.640
they would only stop if Marshal Jiu agreed

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.870
to let them go.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.210
T-That's impossible.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:08.160
If an entire battalion

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.160
of people escape,

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.130
our whole family will be executed!

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.050
Let us go!

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.900
Let us go,

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.220
and we'll release him!

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.790
Mr. Gu?

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.240
Mr. Gu?

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.550
Mr. Su,

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.480
hurry and ask the Viceroy of Liangjiang

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.680
to bring troops here!

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.790
I can't handle this anymore!

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:28.720
Well, I can't...

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.110
But Marshal Jiu has given strict orders

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.880
that no one is allowed to speak of this.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.920
He's afraid of losing face!

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.720
He's not afraid of
losing his life, though.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.100
Among all of us here, the only person

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.850
they'll actually listen to is you.

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.720
Please think of something.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.750
My life and my family's lives

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.430
are all depending on you!

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.200
Braised lamb kidneys, fried combo,

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.400
braised sea cucumber with scallions,

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.530
and smoked venison,

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.550
ready to serve!

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.850
I'm here to deliver food!

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Stop right there!

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:18.720
It's me,

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.800
Gu Pingyuan!

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.100
The Viceroy of Liangjiang

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.240
sent me to supervise the repair work here!

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.640
I need to see Marshal Jiu!

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.540
Whatever you want,

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.440
you can negotiate with me!

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.440
Stop right there!

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.400
Take off your robe!

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.590
Go in!

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.830
Move.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:12.920
Who are you?

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:14.710
You're their leader?

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.600
It's me, Gu Pingyuan,

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.680
the one overseeing the repair work.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.880
I want to see Marshal Jiu.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.140
I'm here to see

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.030
if there's a way I can help you all.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:22.780
Jiu

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.720
killed so many of us.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:26.110
Today we'll

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.350
slice him up and drink to it!

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.920
What help could we need from you?

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.910
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.680
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.080
-Kill Jiu!
-Kill him!

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.490
If you wanted to kill him,
wouldn't you have done it already?

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:38.960
Why wait until now, right?

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.600
Kill Jiu!

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:42.920
Whatever you want,

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.620
it's open to negotiation.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:46.980
What do we want?

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.060
We want to rebel. How about that?

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.270
Don't do it!

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.590
The war has already killed
too many people.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:57.920
No more should die!

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.290
If that's how you want to negotiate,

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:00.890
you might as well kill me now.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.070
What do you suggest then?

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.490
If you ask me—

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.020
I'll sacrifice my career

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.880
to plead with the Viceroy

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.030
and Marshal Jiu on your behalf!

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:10.360
I'll ask for their mercy

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.710
to let you all go home!

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.920
From now on,

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.110
you can all be law-abiding citizens!

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:15.240
How does that sound?

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.770
Law-abiding citizens?

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.260
Gu Pingyuan, oh, Gu Pingyuan.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:23.570
Back then in Hefei,

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.000
you also promised
those surrendered soldiers

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.330
they could live as law-abiding citizens.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:35.200
You know me?

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:37.270
Guys,

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.210
do you know who this man is?

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:40.880
He's the Gu Pingyuan

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.300
who drove our General Li Cheng
to his death!

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:52.440
Guys,

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.840
I didn't kill General Li!

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:56.000
Are you for real?

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:58.430
I want to see Marshal Jiu!

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.130
Don't beat him to death! Don't kill him!

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.340
What if Jiu actually wants to

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.140
see him later?

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.020
Carry him away!

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.430
Get up!

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:24.590
You've beaten me badly.

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:25.000
Hurry up!

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.800
I can't get up.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Cut the nonsense! Get up!

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Alright, alright.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.030
I can walk, I can walk.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.090
You can let go of me.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:39.030
Yu'er.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.130
Why are you here?

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.850
If I hadn't come,

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.440
were you really planning to
make me a widow?

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:45.840
You...

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.820
You recognized me even like this?

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:48.550
Well,

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.310
when I was being

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.960
beaten up earlier,

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.620
why didn't you come to save me?

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.610
There were so many people.

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:55.940
I'm not stupid like you.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.550
You think you're made of iron?

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.070
Come on, put your arm over me.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:00.070
Come on, let's go.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.720
Don't mess things up here for me.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.650
I still need to talk to Marshal Jiu.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.880
You're biting the hand that feeds you,

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:06.550
aren't you?

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.950
Without me, you would've died long ago.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.160
Why haven't you gone over yet?

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.420
Jiu has been urging us!

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.100
Got it!

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:13.270
Coming right away!

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:13.960
I'll shoot him with one arrow,

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.960
and we'll escape.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.400
Stop messing around.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.710
Put down your weapon.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:21.270
Let's walk out with our heads held high.

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.330
I'll show you how your man

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:24.060
pulls off a miraculous escape.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:40.520
Marshal Jiu.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.280
Gu, you're a man of honor.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.790
Just now, when I heard someone barge in,

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:52.720
I knew it was you.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.350
No one else

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.440
has such loyalty.

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:57.830
You've won

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:59.090
battles all your life.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:27:59.680
How did you end up

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.210
stuffed into a rice barrel?

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:01.750
And I got

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.080
beaten up for no reason.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:04.370
Who arranged all this?

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.890
Who's laughing?

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.540
M-Marshal Jiu.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:11.750
Come on.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.820
This is my wife.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:16.960
She was worried about me,

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.360
so she came to protect me.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.960
We're going to release
the imperial court's prisoners—

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.960
our families could lose their heads,
yet you still...

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.440
We've already staked everything on this.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.310
We should've avoided complicated things.

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.960
You officials all

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.640
deceive your superiors
and cover for each other.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.350
Well, how to spin a story

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.930
about releasing prisoners

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.160
is all up to your silver tongues,

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:39.640
right?

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.400
Just leave me out of this.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:47.070
Well, if something goes wrong,
it's your problem.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.160
How is it just my problem?

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.560
You're in this with them.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.830
I...

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.760
M-Marshal Jiu,

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:57.770
a word in private.

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:03.190
Come on, wifey.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:04.160
Take a look. It's eye-opening.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.130
Y-You...

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.830
Have a look.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.340
This...

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.400
We're about to leave.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.060
Do you want to come out and see?

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:19.310
Marshal Jiu, you too.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.010
Let's go.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:42.010
Guys,

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.390
board the ships by squad and unit.
No rushing.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.700
Gu,

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.040
this is my child.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:05.010
Come on.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.590
Thank you, Gu,
for making this possible.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:11.440
From here on,

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.220
we'll be worlds apart,

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.160
unlikely to meet again.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:18.570
Take care of yourself.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:22.640
Ms. Yu'er,

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:24.570
take care of yourself.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:01.700
Marshal Jiu.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:03.800
Well...

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.720
It's been a pleasure working with you.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.180
Earlier, Ms. Su mentioned

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.900
wanting to buy those prisoners from you.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.240
She was afraid
you wouldn't have the courage

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.300
to accept the deal.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.550
I laughed out loud when I heard that.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:16.880
You and "timid" don't belong
in the same sentence,

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:17.350
right?

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:21.860
However...

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.160
you really pulled off

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.290
the self-sacrifice act brilliantly.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.970
You acted better than I did.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.730
As I should.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:31.480
Let me ask you.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.650
I took their gold

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.980
to handle this matter.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.330
What did they offer you?

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:37.610
I want the truth.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.000
Actually, all I wanted was

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.330
to save whoever I could.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.190
The war is over.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.640
I don't want to see any more deaths.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.300
That's all.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.030
This chest of gold

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.960
will help me demobilize
my 50,000 veterans.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.420
If they can't afford food,

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.170
they'll become rebels too.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.260
We've both bought ourselves some peace.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.350
That old fox Rui Lin

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:22.350
actually dared to double-cross me.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.270
Master, please calm down.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.960
-It's not the time to get angry.
-Father.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.090
Where have you been?

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:27.790
I just came back from

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:29.790
the coastal embankment in Nantong.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.250
The Viceroy and Marshal Jiu
also went, right?

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.640
Marshal Jiu went, but not the Viceroy.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.480
I heard Marshal Jiu was fine,

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.030
so I came back.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.270
Good boy, good boy.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:44.960
What's wrong?

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.000
The Master was just about to ask you that.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:48.720
Ask me?

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:49.930
How would I know?

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.960
They say

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.030
Rui Lin has gone back

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:58.270
on his promise about the salt fields.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.480
Jiu.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:13.280
Why haven't you gone back yet?

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.280
Out having fun with your troops?

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:17.510
Your camp is having
a malaria outbreak right now.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.239
I've already sent physicians.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.050
Go back and check immediately.

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:22.880
Move the soldiers and the prisoners

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.880
who haven't caught malaria

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.000
to another camp.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.400
Yes, sir.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.190
The sedan chair for your wife

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:35.550
awaits at the foot of the mountain.

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:37.480
I'll have someone escort her back.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.400
The winds and waves here are treacherous.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.960
A lady of your standing shouldn't be
in such a dangerous place.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.710
When your husband's merits
bring you an imperial title,

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.840
I'll come to offer my congratulations.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.320
Please.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.980
The coastal embankment repairs
are going well.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:58.630
Yes.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.360
After the repair work is completed,

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.240
I'll still need your help.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.000
Walk with me for a bit.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.240
This malaria came on really fiercely.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.780
However,

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.690
those who died were all rebels.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.320
Several thousand people died
in just one night.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.720
It's truly frightening.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.800
Fortunately,

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.110
not a single soldier

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:24.110
of the imperial court was infected.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:26.780
Heaven is watching over us,

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:31.290
and the Emperor and Empress Dowager
are blessed with boundless fortune.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.890
You're right.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.420
They are all blessed
with heavenly fortune.

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:39.150
Long live the Emperor
and the Empress Dowager.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.590
Those who have been infected

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.830
must be careful.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.520
Carrying the disease

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.320
and running around everywhere—

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.030
if the court finds out,

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:52.110
they'll show no mercy.

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:54.590
Please rest assured.

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:56.760
They've all returned to their hometowns.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.070
Those who farm will farm,

00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.800
and those who trade will trade.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:01.320
The war is over.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.340
No more people should die.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:15.230
I agree.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:19.440
Tell me,

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.230
what if I let you

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.090
run the salt fields in Lianghuai?

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.400
That is the most profitable business
in Jiangnan.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.860
Do you have such ambition?

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:30.510
The salt fields in the Lianghuai region

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:32.570
are Jiangnan's primary livelihood.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:35.400
Millions of people depend on them
for their living.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.230
How could we really

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:38.070
hand them over to that father and son?

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.800
They'd burst from greed alone.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.990
If they mismanage them,

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.050
something terrible will happen
sooner or later.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.510
Is the imperial court's management
any better?

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:48.510
I doubt it.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.230
It's just

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:51.760
that money that should have been earned
by merchants

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.360
has ended up in the hands of
corrupt officials.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:56.480
It's really rare to find someone
who talks back

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.760
as much as you do.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.880
The imperial court's salt administration

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.360
has long been a mess.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.800
What I want

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:07.670
is for the people of Lianghuai

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:09.730
to be freed from the imperial court's

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.630
oppression

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.920
without falling into

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.580
the clutches of the Li family.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.840
I want the Salt Industry Guild
to take the lead,

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.400
and as long as they pay taxes uniformly,

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.000
I'll let them manage
the salt fields monopoly.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.480
This is confidential.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:28.030
I've only told you.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:29.460
Well...

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:31.490
True benevolence can seem cruel.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:32.880
If you care so much about

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.370
your friendship with him,

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:35.880
I'll replace you.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:37.630
If I find out

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.480
you've leaked a word of this,

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.080
I'll find some charge

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:43.260
and have you exiled again.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.630
Your personal loyalties,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.710
compared to the livelihood
of Lianghuai's people,

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:48.360
are

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.280
worthless.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:54.170
Don't blame me for being heartless
when the time comes—

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.630
remember this.

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.320
Look at

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:58.630
what this letter says.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.790
The letter says that the Viceroy

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.920
wants to rebuild the salt fields
in Lianghuai,

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.320
but change them from state-operated

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.880
to a system where the Salt Industry Guild

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.100
pays fixed rent and taxes to the court!

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.110
While the Salt Industry Guild

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:12.000
will be controlled
by the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.060
which will appoint

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:13.960
a representative later,

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:14.690
Gu Pingyuan.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.710
That way, our family's private salt fields

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:19.230
will cleverly become

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:20.540
"state-run"!

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.630
It's just

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.960
that they will operate
under a mixed state-private model.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.760
That's right.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:26.070
Exactly!

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.550
I think since
the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:30.110
wants to get involved,

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.450
we might as well openly

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.110
make our move

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:32.910
and let him in!

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:34.280
They may come in,

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.650
but we won't necessarily

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:36.510
let them leave.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.630
It says here

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:42.110
that the operating rights will
belong to the guild.

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:43.150
And who is the guild?

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.190
Isn't it us

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:45.070
and Gu Pingyuan?

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.670
Then we should seize the initiative

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:47.680
and choose first

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:50.030
which salt-administered provinces
our family will manage.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:51.670
Jiangsu and Jiangxi—

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.630
they are major salt-administered provinces

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:55.110
and places where merchants

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.970
from all over the country gather.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:58.230
Jingdezhen

00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:59.400
and the Weaving Bureau

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.320
are where

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.090
the biggest merchants gather.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:03.170
Father,

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:04.800
let's take those two provinces

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.110
and leave the rest to Gu Pingyuan.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:07.150
We'll operate independently.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:09.030
At year's end, just like the Westerners,

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.150
we will set up a Board of Directors

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:12.280
based on profits
to make the final decision—

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.630
according to the scale of operations

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:14.830
and amount of profit,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.480
the losers will have to withdraw.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.790
Let's use this method

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.230
to squeeze
the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office out.

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.110
Then everything else

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:22.970
will be under our control, right?

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.000
Is this

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:27.840
someone else's analysis

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.280
or your own thinking?

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:34.360
I figured it out myself.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:34.890
Just now.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.800
Just now?

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.740
How confident are you?

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.590
I don't want to lose again.

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:50.590
I want to win once.

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:54.880
One, two!

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.730
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.530
One, two!

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.040
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.510
One, two!

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.330
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:04.750
One, two!

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:06.520
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:07.960
One, two!

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.650
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.280
One, two!

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.940
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:14.190
One, two!

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.960
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:17.250
One, two!

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.000
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.520
One, two!

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.000
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.570
One, two!

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.090
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.130
One, two!

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.690
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.230
One, two!

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.700
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.380
One, two!

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:34.960
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:36.340
One, two!

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.040
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.490
One, two!

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:41.040
-Heave-ho!
-Heave-ho!

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:47.630
Okay, okay!

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:49.320
Loosen the rope!

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:54.320
Loosen the rope!

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.550
Loosen it more!

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.190
More!

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.550
-It's connected!
-It's connected!

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.630
-It's connected!
-It's connected!

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.880
Everyone!

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.550
Today marks the completion
of the Nantong coastal embankment.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.680
A weight has been lifted from my heart.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.360
Mr. Li Qin,

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:55.300
Mr. Gu,

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.570
on behalf of the people of Liangjiang,

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.090
I offer you both a toast.

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.710
You're too kind.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:01.640
You're too kind.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.650
Cheers.

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:05.730
-Sit.
-Sit.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:10.110
Our Li family from the capital

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:10.840
is honored to

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.920
do something practical for the people

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.070
of Liangjiang.

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.000
The coastal embankment is well built!

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.530
With the keystone in place,

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.230
barring any unforeseen circumstances,

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:22.880
it will stand for 200 to 300 years!

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:24.800
The people of Nantong

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.630
will no longer need to flee.

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:28.880
The salt industry in Lianghuai

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:31.710
will no longer fear
being ruined by floods too!

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:35.010
These are all thanks to
Your Excellency's efforts.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:36.190
I drink to you.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:43.200
Li Million, you never change,

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.570
always talking business.

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:49.020
As a businessman,

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:51.730
what else would he talk about?

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:54.280
Your Excellency,
a distinguished guest has arrived!

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.610
Quickly invite them in.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:56.170
Come on.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.280
A distinguished guest.
