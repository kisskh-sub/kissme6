00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.530
Good morning.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.050
Do you want some coffee?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.220
Sure.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.860
Incorrect password.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.810
Oh, no...

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.560
Incorrect password.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.460
Hurry up.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.500
Jin.

00:02:16.844 --> 00:02:18.111
How many times have I told you

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:19.520
you need to change your door lock?

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.780
The characters are too small.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.960
I either press the wrong number

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.511
or press the wrong spot every time.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.010
Alright.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.000
Wait for Double 11,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.500
then I'll get a face recognition one.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.530
Mom, why did you come so suddenly?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.560
Your dad and I

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.690
bought insurance, right?

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.710
The insurance company gave us rice,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.430
eggs, and flax seed oil.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.460
I brought you a set.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.130
Hello, Mrs. Cen.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.570
Wu, you are here too.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.630
I'm here

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.900
to borrow a power strip.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.240
Then just keep it.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.940
No need to return.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.460
Have you had breakfast?

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.290
I'll eat when I get back.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.180
Okay.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.100
Then...

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.530
What setup are you arranging here?

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.530
I just took on a case.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.500
Product testing.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.360
Mom, why did you bring so much?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.630
Just keep it for you guys to eat.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.570
I'm not cooking.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.500
I kept some.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.800
Well, send a WeChat

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.620
to Dr. Lu.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.470
Better give me a menu,

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.530
so I can prepare too.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.560
Isn't it Saturday for the meal?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.180
Why the rush?

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.688
Besides, even if I ask him,

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.840
he might not feel comfortable saying it.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.133
You should have a good attitude

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:38.100
if you invite someone to eat.
You'll be clueless if not prepared.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.500
Mrs. Cen...

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.780
You haven't left?

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.010
Well...

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.630
I happen to be free on Saturday.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.010
How about I come and help you out?

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.100
Sure.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.030
A friend of your sister

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.900
is coming for a meal.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.560
He knows you,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.022
and he even mentioned you to me.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.530
When?

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.800
Last time,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.710
I didn't come up.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.430
I asked Dr. Lu

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.840
to bring up the fruits.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.850
He told me.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.970
Wu.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.000
You just

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.940
come eat together.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.100
And also help your sister

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.010
check everything.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.100
Okay.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.660
No problem.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.290
Paopao.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.900
Bring me some ice.

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:23.160
Mr. Shen,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.266
are you helping again today?

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.700
Wait a moment.

00:04:26.755 --> 00:04:27.430
Long time no see.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.410
Come, sit, have a drink.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.360
No thanks.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.240
If I drink,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.160
no one will work.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.000
Just one drink.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.070
- Come, sit.
- One drink.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.730
Come.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.270
Open one for me.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.600
Long time no see.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.560
This boss lady is getting more
and more beautiful.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.100
Yeah.

00:04:40.133 --> 00:04:41.977
- Chun Chang.
- What have you been busy with lately?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.333
How did you end up here?

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.220
This is...

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.220
Chun Chang.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.310
Please introduce.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.170
Who is this?

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.340
My friend.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.240
- Friend?
- Friend?

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.950
Really?

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.200
If she says so, then it is.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.800
Friend, huh? Come, sit.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.510
Sit together.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.730
Come. Together.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.040
Come.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.870
Here, some liquor.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.160
- A glass for the friend.
- Fill it up.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.140
Let's have a drink first.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.120
To our new friend.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.830
Cheers. Come.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.340
Cheers.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.190
- Come.
- Fifteen or twenty.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.660
Come.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.170
No.

00:05:13.244 --> 00:05:15.266
You should stop drinking.
I'll drink for you.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.970
Come, another round.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.630
One more round.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.580
Another round, come.

00:05:40.755 --> 00:05:42.720
Three cuts, three cuts.
Four cuts, four cuts.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.530
What's wrong?

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.020
A little dizzy.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:48.530
One more round.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.970
Change place and rest a bit.

00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:53.088
- Five cuts, five cuts.
- Three cuts, three cuts.

00:05:55.933 --> 00:05:57.120
How do you have time today

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.020
to come see me?

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.490
I have a business trip tomorrow.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.920
After the trip,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.511
you won't see me for several days.

00:06:07.511 --> 00:06:08.355
Will you miss me?

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.070
What did you mean

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.050
just now downstairs?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.970
Claiming territory?

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.290
What do you think?

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.850
Wu.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.410
You're 25 or 26 this year, right?

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.490
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.370
Not yet.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.170
Then you'd better hurry.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.820
What kind of girl do you like?

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.610
I like...

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.530
I like pretty ones.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.070
Young people always look

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.610
for good-looking partners.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.600
So now,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.730
do you have someone in mind?

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.000
If you do,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.580
go for it immediately.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.490
Boys must be more proactive.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.050
But being proactive...

00:07:40.822 --> 00:07:43.066
I'm just afraid
that sometimes being too proactive

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.660
might make things worse.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.800
You're young,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.050
but think a lot.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:49.850
How about this?

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:51.510
If you have

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.560
a girl you like,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.290
bring her to me.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.780
I'll help you make a move.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:58.930
Alright.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.730
Mom.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.430
Do the ribs you bought

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.560
need a clay pot?

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.190
Of course.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.490
For soup, definitely a clay pot.

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:11.622
But your clay pot
hasn't been used for a long time.

00:08:11.666 --> 00:08:13.066
Take it down and wash it well.

00:08:36.577 --> 00:08:37.490
Mrs. Cen, I'll go then.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.060
Coming.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.130
I remember there
are slippers here, right?

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.770
Please sit.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.650
- Lu.
- Mrs. Cen.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.540
Welcome.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.600
The Phalaenopsis you like.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.400
I happened to buy a few
at the flower shop.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.270
Thanks.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.840
This is imported honey.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.480
Remember,

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.510
drink with warm water
every night before bed.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.130
It can improve sleep.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.820
Got it, thanks.

00:09:30.933 --> 00:09:31.840
Do you want me to help?

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.480
No.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.220
Jin, come.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:33.890
Quick.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.180
Sit with Dr. Lu for a while.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.580
Go, sit.

00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:37.550
Sit for a while.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.970
Okay.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.300
Why so polite? You even bring gifts.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.180
For you.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:42.840
Thanks.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.460
You're welcome.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.610
So lavish.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.630
Yeah.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.890
My mom is just like that.

00:10:11.955 --> 00:10:13.266
Do you want something to drink?

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.770
Water or tea?

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:15.850
Water is fine.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:16.970
Okay.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.080
Wu.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.177
Bring me the green onions.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:19.890
Okay.

00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:32.688
I want a bottle of water.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:51.840
Thanks.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.420
A bit cold.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.300
It's fine.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.288
Sister. You've got
all this strawberry jam

00:11:03.355 --> 00:11:05.120
in the fridge, but you never eat it.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.355
Aren't you afraid they'll spoil?

00:11:08.244 --> 00:11:09.890
I forgot you don't like sweet things.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.850
Who says I don't like sweets?

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.820
Don't mess with my stuff.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:28.940
Well,

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.440
last time, you said

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.644
you wanted to try that liquor,

00:11:31.666 --> 00:11:32.533
but didn't get to.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.730
I brought it.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.540
You actually remembered.

00:11:36.666 --> 00:11:37.820
I'll go find the corkscrew.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.060
Looking for what?

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.420
Corkscrew.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.420
Why isn't it here?

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.240
The liquor is by the door.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:51.720
I'll get it.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.100
Okay.

00:11:53.111 --> 00:11:54.155
Do you have one at home?

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.940
Probably. You can check it.

00:12:01.866 --> 00:12:03.060
I'll go get the corkscrew.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:53.730
Here.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.720
Let's welcome

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.220
Lu to our home.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.340
First, a toast.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.120
Here.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:58.960
Welcome.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.270
Thanks, Mrs. Cen and you guys.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:00.850
Welcome.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:06.770
Just eat, Lu.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:07.940
Then I won't be polite.

00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:14.066
Mrs. Cen, your braised bamboo shoots

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.730
taste just like I had as a kid.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.970
Very similar to my mom's.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.180
I'm telling you.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.390
My cooking skills

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.490
are top-notch.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:23.820
If you like it,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.580
you're welcome to come often.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.030
Then I won't be polite.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.888
Thank you, Mrs. Cen.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.060
I should thank you.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.670
If you weren't so thoughtful,

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.111
I couldn't have recovered so well.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.120
You're too polite.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:33.970
It's what I should do.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.130
Cen Jin.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.150
This soup has been

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.150
cooked for so long.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.940
It's so good.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.460
Serve a bowl for Lu.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.010
Are you okay?

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.060
Burned a bit?

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.180
It's okay.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.088
Look at this.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.250
Anyway, he's a doctor.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.490
So thoughtful.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.370
Hurry, put some on.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.644
You're not burned, right?

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:09.850
It's fine.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.150
I'll serve.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.700
Lu.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.370
Sorry.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:14.770
Cen Jin

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.080
excels in both her job

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.220
and her studies,

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.440
except for housework.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.340
She's really bad at it.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.010
Her dad and I spoiled her.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.390
I often tell her dad,

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.000
if she gets married in the future,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.266
what will their life be like?

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.250
Thanks.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.130
Well...

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:32.940
Actually, Mrs. Cen, I think

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.850
as of now, this isn't really a problem.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.870
Right now,

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.888
she works so hard every day.

00:14:40.888 --> 00:14:42.733
There's no need to insist she
do housework.

00:14:42.755 --> 00:14:43.790
If really needed,

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:44.700
just hire a cleaner.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.250
That's a good idea.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.610
Actually,

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.320
living together

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.479
is always about both people.
If you work together...

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.120
Mom, your braised pork

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.420
looks especially good today.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:59.820
Since it looks good,

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.220
let Lu have a taste.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:09.890
Here.

00:15:10.066 --> 00:15:11.044
- Thanks.
- Try it.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.670
Right?

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:19.650
So delicious, Mrs. Cen.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.130
Everything tastes great.

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.420
I think these bamboo shoots
are good.

00:15:24.711 --> 00:15:26.044
Aren't you allergic to shrimp?

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.370
I forgot.

00:15:32.888 --> 00:15:33.770
Here, you can eat this.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.220
Mrs. Cen.

00:15:43.422 --> 00:15:44.490
I'll pour another glass.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:45.370
Okay.

00:15:46.466 --> 00:15:48.180
Thanks for your
hard work today, Mrs. Cen.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.720
Next month,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.970
I'll move into my new house.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.390
You must come visit

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.550
and try my cooking.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:56.510
Sure.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:57.550
We should

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.700
visit each other back and forth.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.220
- Cheers.
- Here.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:02.180
Cheers.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.130
You shouldn't drink.

00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:05.422
You're still on medicine.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.060
Medicine?

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:08.130
What's wrong?

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.730
I've been busy with overtime lately,

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.790
so my immunity dropped.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:13.733
It's much better now.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.490
You need to take care of yourself.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.311
Mrs. Cen, eat some vegetables.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:21.770
Okay.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.540
Try this.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:26.970
Lu.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.250
Drink the soup.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:28.890
Okay.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.790
Later,

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.220
remember to order a driver for Lu.

00:16:33.244 --> 00:16:34.540
Absolutely no driving himself.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.340
Got it?

00:16:35.488 --> 00:16:36.420
Don't worry, Mrs. Cen.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.650
Understood, Mom.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.630
I'll do it.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.130
Okay.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.700
Thanks.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:41.610
I'll leave then.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.010
Bye.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.200
Bye, Mrs. Cen.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:44.700
All done.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.540
Bye.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:46.220
Let's go.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.960
I'll call a driver for you.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.580
I already did.

00:16:56.022 --> 00:16:57.111
Should be here soon.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.250
Then I'll wait with you.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.130
Okay.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.610
What do you think of me?

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.888
Do I meet your expectations?

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:18.820
I...

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.740
I think you're really nice.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.210
I also think you're quite good.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.020
Regardless of hobbies,

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.110
career, family, and values,

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.133
all are compatible.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.260
But maybe...

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.500
You feel there's not
enough understanding between us.

00:17:42.288 --> 00:17:44.222
But that's okay. We can take it slowly.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:46.890
Just like Mrs. Cen said,

00:17:49.244 --> 00:17:50.450
it's a matter of two people.

00:17:51.955 --> 00:17:53.222
As long as we cooperate well,

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.500
everything will be fine.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.030
I didn't expect

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.410
you to suddenly tell me this.

00:18:03.444 --> 00:18:05.070
I didn't expect either why I suddenly

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.300
told you this today.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.440
Originally, I wanted to wait

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.740
until you met my parents,

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.980
so you could understand me better,

00:18:15.466 --> 00:18:17.066
and then I'd ask for your thoughts.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.170
Are you willing for our relationship

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.100
to move a step further?

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:40.650
I...

00:18:41.022 --> 00:18:42.610
You don't have to answer me right away.

00:18:43.066 --> 00:18:44.577
You can take some time to think.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:50.540
Sorry.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.930
Actually, being with you all this time

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.690
has always made me feel

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.690
comfortable and safe.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:01.960
But maybe I do

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.260
still need some time.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:07.590
It's okay.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:08.540
Just tell me

00:19:08.933 --> 00:19:10.610
as soon as you've made up your mind.

00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:16.644
Go upstairs quickly.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.100
You'll catch a cold otherwise.

00:19:18.133 --> 00:19:19.410
The driver should be here soon.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.540
Then I'll leave first.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.340
Okay.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.850
Good night.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:25.740
Good night.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.210
You're back.

00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:59.980
Have you been taking your medicine
on time lately?

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.650
Yes.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.060
Really?

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.740
Then what is this?

00:20:28.088 --> 00:20:30.311
Why did you stop taking
your medicine yourself?

00:20:30.911 --> 00:20:32.200
Didn't you promise me...

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.260
If my headache is gone,

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.688
will you still care about me?

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.300
What did you say?

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.540
Take me back,

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.260
bring me home,

00:20:53.822 --> 00:20:55.060
and take me to get treatment...

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.260
Is it because of guilt?

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.100
You don't need to feel guilty.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.070
If all you want

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.930
is to cut me out as a problem,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.930
you can just say it.

00:21:15.622 --> 00:21:16.750
Of course, I don't want

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:17.850
this problem to disappear.

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:21.740
I know what you're going to say.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.500
You're basically saying

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.500
that I'm immature.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.100
I'm unwilling to accept it.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.780
I'm tired of hearing these words.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.720
Cen Jin.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.070
I've already told you

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.370
I'm not a child anymore.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.260
During the half-year after we separated,

00:21:41.488 --> 00:21:43.111
every night, when I closed my eyes,

00:21:43.133 --> 00:21:44.088
I dreamt of you.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.310
I was scared to dream of you,

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:47.688
but also wanted to dream of you.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.590
Later, I stayed up

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:51.410
whole nights.

00:21:53.511 --> 00:21:54.440
I even went to see

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.650
the school psychologist.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.300
He told me

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.450
that time will solve everything.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.300
Time can fade everything.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
But why does time

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.060
not work on me?

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.200
So when I realized

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.780
letting go of you was futile,

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:20.540
I tried my hardest.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.850
What I want

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.610
is just the qualification to stand
in front of you.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:33.370
I thought

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.890
we had already reached a consensus.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.300
You want to move forward,

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.030
and my duty is to help you move on...

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:41.610
Duty?

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.210
Is it just duty?

00:22:46.533 --> 00:22:47.270
I'm not either...

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.200
If I didn't say this,

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.300
would you come closer to me?

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.340
Yes.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.170
I admit I lied to you.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.880
This may seem

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.820
dishonorable to you.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.820
I also feel ashamed.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:00.890
But...

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.850
I just can't help but approach you.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.370
I know what I'm doing.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.300
And you?

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.100
Can you guarantee

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.170
it's just duty?

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:35.100
Just treating me as a younger brother?

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.130
It's too late.

00:23:46.066 --> 00:23:46.880
I'm going to sleep.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.822
You should rest too.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:22.060
(Sorry.)

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.170
Hello.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.790
Hi, we are from Yanbei University's

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:22.540
Admissions Office.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.170
May I ask if you are Li Wu's parent?

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:30.060
Yes, I am.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.340
Then, may I ask if Li Wu

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.580
has finalized
his college application plans?

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.260
Is he considering Yanbei University?

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.170
Sure.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.260
Then I'll contact you again.

00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:45.822
University of Science and Technology?

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.350
This still depends on him

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.510
checking his scores

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:52.930
and then making a decision.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:54.450
Jiaotong University?

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.850
We'll consider it.

00:25:57.555 --> 00:25:58.340
Fudan University?

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.540
Okay.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.300
We will contact you again.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.100
Thank you.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.580
Jin.

00:26:10.088 --> 00:26:12.370
You haven't stopped
taking calls all afternoon.

00:26:13.733 --> 00:26:14.930
My brother is too outstanding.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.070
Even keeping a low profile

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.850
is impossible.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.030
But the NCEE results

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.300
haven't come out yet.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:22.210
You didn't know that?

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.920
Universities pre-select

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.540
top students nationwide.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.020
Really?

00:26:27.333 --> 00:26:28.755
First time I've heard about this.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.690
I don't understand

00:26:31.888 --> 00:26:33.044
the world of top students.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:34.370
Congratulations.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:35.820
Thanks.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.650
(How about eating dinner out?)

00:26:45.755 --> 00:26:48.000
(I'll send you the address
after I choose a place.)

00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:59.100
(Okay.)

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:00.580
I'll go first.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.260
Where are you going?

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.780
I'll have dinner with my sister.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.160
Then go ahead.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.000
I won't disturb you.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:07.450
Bye.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.210
Bye.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.300
You can't leave me alone.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.780
Alright.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.111
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't get rid of you.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.690
Cheers.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:34.690
Here, eat.

00:27:41.888 --> 00:27:43.977
By the way, have you decided
on your university choice?

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.540
Not yet.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.310
Quite a few schools

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.333
have contacted you, right?

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.690
I've received so many calls.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:50.850
Yes.

00:27:52.511 --> 00:27:54.177
Not a single one you want to go to?

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:55.690
Not really.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:57.610
I just

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.540
haven't decided yet.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.210
It's okay. Take your time.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:07.370
Where did you go to university?

00:28:08.644 --> 00:28:09.866
At Yijiang University.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.130
School of Journalism.

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.580
Our faculty is the best.

00:28:17.222 --> 00:28:18.650
Did Yijiang University contact you?

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:20.370
Yes.

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:22.690
After the third mock exam,
they asked me

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.270
to pre-register

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.170
at their university.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.610
That's impressive.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:28.820
I admire you.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.130
Truly my good brother.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:38.060
But you didn't agree, right?

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:40.370
No.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:42.060
At that time,

00:28:42.066 --> 00:28:43.888
I was fully focused on preparing
for the exam.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.210
If I were you,

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.370
I'd choose a better school,

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:50.890
like Yanbei University

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:52.020
or Huaqing.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:53.240
That way, I could meet

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.100
even better people.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:03.650
But...

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.540
If I go to Yan City,

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:13.450
I might rarely come home.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.610
Of course.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.110
No one goes to university

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.600
and comes home all the time.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:26.820
What are you doing?

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.650
You're not reluctant to leave me, right?

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.210
It'll always be like this.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.300
When you grow up,
you have to fly far away.

00:29:43.888 --> 00:29:45.370
It's not like you won't come back.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:57.650
Do you still remember?

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:58.650
Back then,

00:29:58.777 --> 00:30:00.610
I only asked you to get
into a 211 university.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.060
But you far exceeded expectations.

00:30:04.488 --> 00:30:05.750
This proves that your potential

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:06.790
needs a bigger world

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:07.650
to grow.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:15.200
I wonder if you have

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.500
plans to study physics.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.200
Recently, I looked into
Huaqing's physics program.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.370
It is the best in the country.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.130
If you're interested,

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.200
I have a friend

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.300
from when I studied abroad

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.450
who was just hired as a teacher.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:28.780
I can ask him for you.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:39.000
Alright, enough.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.740
I can't finish it.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:43.580
Not for now.

00:30:52.711 --> 00:30:54.580
What's wrong with you?
You're allergic to it.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:57.980
Here.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:01.930
Wipe your hands.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:12.750
It's okay.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.170
I'm just giving you some advice.

00:31:15.466 --> 00:31:17.000
Anyway, there are still over 20 days.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.260
You can think it over slowly.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.370
(If I go to Yan City,)

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.540
(I might rarely come home.)

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:53.030
(Of course.)

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.400
(No one goes to university)

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.822
(and comes home all the time.)

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.820
You're not reluctant to leave me, right?

(Sister)

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.180
(Send)

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:17.700
(Sending image)

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:24.810
Li Wu.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:26.940
You're amazing!

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.060
How are you so awesome?

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.610
You really are great.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:39.380
You've worked hard lately.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.580
(Dad)

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.060
Hello.

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:50.060
Dad.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:51.380
It's out.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.250
Seven hundred eighteen points.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:54.650
Impressive, right?

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:57.210
Really great.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.900
Jin.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:23.610
Wu is really capable.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.940
I never expected

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.500
he'd manage the house.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.130
I can't even get involved.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.730
Unlike some people.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.630
Why suddenly

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:33.900
drag me into this?

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.360
Wu is simply excellent.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.550
I just want to praise him.

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:37.250
Isn't that okay?

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.730
Sure.

00:35:39.533 --> 00:35:41.060
How's his university application going?

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:43.420
Still considering.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.020
But with his score,

00:35:45.066 --> 00:35:46.290
Huaqing should be guaranteed.

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:47.330
Really?

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:49.710
Now you can

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:50.690
completely relax.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:52.940
I wasn't very worried anyway.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:53.900
You know,

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:55.500
during this time,

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.150
I received many calls

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:58.630
from universities,

00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:59.730
all competing for Li Wu.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.230
So that's how it feels

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.622
to be a parent of a top student.

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.840
If only I had tried harder back then,

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.510
so you and Dad could experience

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:09.580
this pride.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.150
Wu, you're back.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:13.730
Mrs. Cen.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.100
Don't worry. I'll hang it.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.020
You hang it?

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.420
If you really want to make me happy,

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.580
think about your own matters.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.280
What matters?

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.940
Don't play dumb with me.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.460
Wu is about to go to university.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:42.800
We've done our part

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.866
and fulfilled our duty.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.280
Shouldn't you

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.020
think about

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.770
your own matters?

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:51.500
How long have you been divorced?

00:36:51.622 --> 00:36:52.650
What do you want to do?

00:36:52.688 --> 00:36:54.533
Stay single for the rest of your life?

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.380
That's possible.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.540
Give up this thought, okay?

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.730
Being single

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:02.500
isn't that easy.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:04.320
You're young now.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.320
You can enjoy life.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.866
Who will be with you when you're old?

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.440
Your third aunt

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.770
keeps mentioning it to me.

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:13.690
She says, with your conditions,

00:37:13.777 --> 00:37:15.320
those who haven't been married before

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.650
have gradually come asking.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.760
So I think if you're willing,

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.760
let your third aunt

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.730
set up a meeting.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.650
You can meet them individually.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.130
Mom.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.400
I have a job

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.730
where I can really perform,

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.130
earn money and have a sense
of achievement.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.590
I really live

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:34.810
very fulfilling days.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.810
I just think simply about

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:38.860
how to do things well.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.230
I really feel

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.130
these years

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.860
are the most comfortable time for me.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:43.810
Um...

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.380
Shouldn't people always look forward?

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:47.630
I never asked you

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:49.330
to remarry immediately.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.760
Besides work, can you

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.280
socialize more?

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.320
Meet more people.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.330
What's wrong with that?

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.250
The other day, I saw

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.020
your college classmate,
Jiao's social media.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.100
Look how happy she is with her life.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.810
Alright, Mom.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.900
I need to go to work.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:08.860
If you have nothing else,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.100
go back and rest.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.800
Don't hold up
your afternoon mahjong game.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.590
Look at you.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.111
Whenever I talk about serious matters,

00:38:15.155 --> 00:38:16.377
you always change the topic.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.580
Li Wu.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.400
I'll probably be home late tonight.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.510
Don't wait for me for dinner.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:23.533
Take care of yourself.

00:38:23.533 --> 00:38:24.110
No need.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:24.920
I'll cook here.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:25.810
I'll eat with Wu.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.380
Mom, I'm leaving.

00:38:27.488 --> 00:38:28.480
I'll book a ride for you.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.022
As soon as I arrive, you'll kick me out.

00:38:30.044 --> 00:38:31.030
Who dares?

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.860
Wu, I'm leaving.

00:38:31.888 --> 00:38:33.210
- Bye, Mrs. Cen.
- Bye.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.060
(Chinese Universities)

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:44.940
Hello.

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:46.250
Li Wu.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.580
Has Wen contacted you?

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:48.650
No.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.460
Why?

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.500
Wen disappeared.

00:39:51.822 --> 00:39:52.933
Her parents came to my place

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:53.770
early this morning,

00:39:53.844 --> 00:39:55.920
saying when she started filling
in her choices yesterday,

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:56.980
she didn't tell her family

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.244
and applied to Yanbei University's
Journalism program.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.510
All her other parallel choices

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:02.533
were journalism programs
in other provinces.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.190
This morning, she disappeared.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:05.320
Her room is all cleaned up.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.540
And her phone is off.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.800
Her parents are going crazy looking for her.
I contacted a lot of people.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.951
They all said they didn't know.

00:40:11.951 --> 00:40:12.688
Where are you?

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:13.420
I'll come find you.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:15.130
I'm at the station now.

00:40:15.377 --> 00:40:16.420
I'll send you the address.

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:21.420
How did she go to Yan City?

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.650
How should I know?

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.420
Are we going now?

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:28.488
Of course.
She's alone in a different city.

00:40:28.488 --> 00:40:30.770
- What if something happens?
- Should we inform her family?

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.060
No.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:33.190
Look.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.130
She just warned me.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.150
If I tell them,

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:36.100
she'll cut ties with me.

00:40:36.177 --> 00:40:38.577
Then move somewhere else,
so I won't find her either.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.150
Are you coming with me or not?

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.940
One word.

00:40:42.133 --> 00:40:43.070
Give me half a minute.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:43.770
I'll make a call.

00:40:45.088 --> 00:40:45.630
Who is it?

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:46.980
Don't worry. I'll call my sister

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:48.070
to explain it,

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:48.900
so she won't worry.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:49.960
Don't worry.

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:50.770
I won't betray you.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:02.690
(Sister)

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:05.030
(Cheng Rui and I
are going to Yan City.)

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.955
(We'll be back soon.)

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:06.730
(Don't worry.)

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:08.770
Done?

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:10.020
Let's go.

00:41:16.755 --> 00:41:17.860
Make sure it's done quickly.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.980
Okay.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:31.340
