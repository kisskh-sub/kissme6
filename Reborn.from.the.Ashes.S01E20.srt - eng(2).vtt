[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 20]

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.800
Your Highness, you randomly
picked someone on the street

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.440
and claimed she was a midwife.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.960
She casually mentioned
I have a birthmark.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.670
How am I supposed to explain that?

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.550
Your Highness,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.190
when his mother gave birth,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.270
you were right there.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.360
Why don't you check
if she was the midwife back then?

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.190
She was.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.960
Jin,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.320
how do you explain this?

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.480
Are you sure the birthmark
is on the waist?

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.520
Do you realize

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.110
accusing the crown prince
is a grave crime?

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.270
Think carefully before you speak.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.110
Yes.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.040
Very well.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.670
Then let me show you.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.660
He actually took the initiative
to take off his clothes.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.110
Wanyan Jin, what are you really up to?

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.880
Your Highness,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.670
let me help you.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.070
Where's the Qilin Mark?

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.550
The Qilin Mark is a hidden risk.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.230
Looks like it needs to be dealt with
as soon as possible.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.880
My Lord,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.360
this is

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.900
the medicine you asked me to find

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.190
that can make a fresh wound
look like an old scar.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.230
Your Highness,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.920
he has no birthmark.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.960
He's an imposter.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.110
When I was young,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.800
there was a hunter in the village

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.880
who thought I am agile,

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.690
so he took me into the mountains
to hunt.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.230
Once, we encountered a brown bear,

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.750
and I lost a piece of flesh to its bite.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.920
The birthmark was gone back then.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.590
Jin,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.590
you've been through a lot.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.920
It happened to be bitten off
by a brown bear.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.630
Wanyan Jin, that's a bit too
coincidental.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.440
Then let's do the blood test
for paternity.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.590
Since everyone thinks

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.250
all the evidence is just a coincidence,

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.000
then let's do a blood test.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.800
Whether he is real or not,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.290
the test will make it clear.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.770
What do you think, Your Highness?

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.000
Let's do it.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.440
Your Highness, please.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.360
I added alum to the water.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.110
Even if it is a dog, it would be

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.960
Wanyan Lie's child.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.320
My Consort,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.000
this is highly improper.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.070
Your Highness,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.710
it was my fault.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.710
I was confused for a moment.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.320
Please, show me mercy this once.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.440
Confused?

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.850
You were confused
about something like this?

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.400
Someone!

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.190
The princess consort has acted
improperly.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.840
Lock her in her chambers

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.520
and make sure
she can reflect on herself.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.670
Without my permission,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.940
she shall not leave the mansion.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.040
Yes.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.440
When did you find out?

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.000
I didn't know before.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.750
But now, it's confirmed.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.270
And I also know

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.150
you are

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.880
Qilin Army.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.230
I had been wondering

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.110
why you were spying on Su Mansion too.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.710
Later, Su Guang was imprisoned.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.360
He told me you were also asking
about the account book.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.770
I couldn't understand it at first

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.840
until I saw it.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.590
Why has your Qilin Mark disappeared?

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.960
Keeping it was a risk in the end.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.840
So I removed it.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.710
And then?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.880
Then

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.230
I started wondering.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.550
If your Qilin Army identity was real,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.520
then was your crown prince identity
true or false?

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.960
So,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.230
I tested it.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.150
Inside here is alum.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.320
It can let the blood merge.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.440
If you really are Wanyan Jin,

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.840
I have nothing to lose.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.670
But if you're not,

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.710
then

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.070
I got my answer.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.110
You are amazing,

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.270
Wen Yueqian.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.270
You...

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.710
I know.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.070
You've long known
I'm not the real Su Qingran.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.270
But how did you know I am Wen Yueqian?

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.520
Is it that hard to guess?

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.750
Same face,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.320
same grudge against the Wanyan Family.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.880
Wanyan Qi and the others don't know,

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.750
because they can't believe
in resurrection.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.000
But I

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.480
have this.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.110
How could I not believe?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.880
Then,

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.920
can you tell me

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.550
your real name now?

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.880
My name is

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.440
Xiao Jin.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.000
Xiao Jin.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.990
You came to the Prince Zhenbei's Mansion

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.270
for revenge.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.750
Since Wanyan Lie trusts you so much.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.800
Why didn't you just kill him directly?

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.750
He's caused the death of so many.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.440
If he dies too easily,

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.040
wouldn't that be letting him off
too lightly?

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.070
That's true.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.710
Wen Yueqian,

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.920
meeting you

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.960
has made me very happy.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.190
Xiao Jin,

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.320
traveling this road with you,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.480
having you by my side,

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.980
gives me great peace of mind.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.040
Then let's agree

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.110
to walk this road

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.480
together.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.550
May we both achieve what we desire.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.000
We will make Wanyan Lie pay the price
he deserves.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.440
You really have a refined hobby.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.670
Back then,

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.920
Yueqian and I used
to release sky lanterns together.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.360
If you say so,

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.710
someone unaware might think

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.550
you still miss your late wife deeply.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.840
She is indeed unforgettable.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.150
You still watch him.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.400
Or your true feelings might slip out.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.320
True feelings?

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.880
What a joke.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.800
As for him,

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.590
I only have the hatred
of gouging out my eyes,

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.670
the pain of cutting my flesh.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.040
Someone, an assassin!

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.230
Does it hurt?

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.070
You know what pain is too.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.350
Then do you know

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.800
how much she suffered back then?

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.350
Who is she?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.040
Wanyan Qi,

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.760
you had her but didn't cherish her.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.310
You betrayed her and hurt her deeply.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.430
You deserve to die.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.880
Close your eyes,

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.430
or I'll kill you right now.
