DYNAMITE KISS

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:56.786
SEON-U

00:01:02.876 --> 00:01:05.795
I'll get going then.

00:01:14.637 --> 00:01:15.555
Let's have a meal.

00:01:16.848 --> 00:01:17.724
You and me.

00:01:22.353 --> 00:01:24.522
I already have plans.

00:01:24.606 --> 00:01:25.690
Cancel them.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:28.610
And stay with me.

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:32.030
What?

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:33.781
Don't go.

00:01:35.742 --> 00:01:36.910
I don't want you to go.

00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:11.694
Just because you think I'm easy

00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:13.154
doesn't mean you can do this.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.241
Who said you were easy?

00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:19.035
I'm so disappointed in you.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.666
Disappointed?

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:30.546
Da-rim.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.174
Hold on. Da-rim, wait.

00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:41.599
I like you.

00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:44.519
I really like you.

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:46.688
I have

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.731
ever since I met you.

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.528
What are you talking about?

00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:55.488
You can't do this.

00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:56.948
What about Ms. Yu?

00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:58.616
You'll be marrying her soon.

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:02.662
Our families
are just pushing us to be together.

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.456
We have absolutely no attraction
to each other.

00:03:08.793 --> 00:03:10.128
The person I like

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.130
is you.

00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:23.307
Why would you like me?

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.811
-Sorry?
-You have no reason to.

00:03:30.314 --> 00:03:31.399
You think I'm easy, huh?

00:03:31.983 --> 00:03:34.193
Are you trying to get back at me
for playing with you?

00:03:34.277 --> 00:03:35.153
Is that it?

00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:36.362
No, it's not.

00:03:39.157 --> 00:03:40.658
I really mean it.

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.289
I'm going to pretend

00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:49.042
that nothing happened tonight.

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:51.836
I'll find a new job as soon as possible.

00:03:53.087 --> 00:03:53.963
Wait.

00:04:03.056 --> 00:04:03.890
Da-rim.

00:04:05.391 --> 00:04:06.684
Hey, Seon-u.

00:04:06.768 --> 00:04:07.602
Let's go eat.

00:04:09.562 --> 00:04:13.107
I'm sorry,
but I'm just going to head home.

00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.651
Did something happen?

00:04:16.527 --> 00:04:18.613
No, nothing happened.

00:04:18.696 --> 00:04:20.615
I just want to go home.

00:04:20.698 --> 00:04:21.532
Wait, Da…

00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:52.814
EPISODE 10

00:04:55.483 --> 00:04:56.984
I saw him being all lovey-dovey
with his fiancée.

00:04:57.068 --> 00:04:58.736
Why would he lie about that?

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.946
Damn it.

00:05:01.447 --> 00:05:03.157
Then again,

00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:04.992
I lied first.

00:05:05.785 --> 00:05:07.036
I don't have a leg to stand on.

00:05:47.827 --> 00:05:50.079
This is terrible.

00:05:52.707 --> 00:05:55.459
You've experienced
that firsthand as well, right?

00:05:57.753 --> 00:06:00.214
Don't tell me you've also…

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:03.050
I've experienced it as well.

00:06:03.134 --> 00:06:04.468
You too, Go-eun?

00:06:05.303 --> 00:06:06.262
Of course.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.351
Look, he just won't stop.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.230
He's a repeat offender…

00:06:20.109 --> 00:06:20.985
Look at it yourself.

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:26.032
The graph doesn't reflect
the text data at all, does it?

00:06:26.657 --> 00:06:28.117
My eyesight has been a bit fuzzy.

00:06:28.201 --> 00:06:29.577
-My age must be catching up to me.
-Look at…

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.037
Look at this.

00:06:31.662 --> 00:06:33.372
Look at this here.

00:06:33.456 --> 00:06:34.624
Does that look right to you?

00:06:34.707 --> 00:06:36.876
How many times
do I need to teach you the basics?

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:38.920
How are you still not getting it?

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.551
You may leave.

00:06:45.635 --> 00:06:47.470
Yes, sir.

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:01.609
Our families
are just pushing us to be together.

00:07:01.692 --> 00:07:03.986
We have absolutely no attraction
to each other.

00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:07.448
Was I mistaken?

00:07:08.491 --> 00:07:09.867
Then…

00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:11.160
I like you.

00:07:11.244 --> 00:07:12.536
I really like you.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.205
I have

00:07:15.373 --> 00:07:16.499
ever since I met you.

00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:19.043
He was telling the truth?

00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:23.839
Even so, how would that make any sense?

00:07:24.549 --> 00:07:25.883
He's a son of a chaebol family

00:07:25.967 --> 00:07:28.386
who's also successful and handsome.

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:30.596
He's basically perfect.

00:07:31.681 --> 00:07:33.391
Meanwhile, I have nothing at all,

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.560
with no talents to speak of,

00:07:37.186 --> 00:07:39.438
and just a history of habitual lying.

00:07:41.232 --> 00:07:42.525
There's no way he'd like me.

00:07:49.448 --> 00:07:52.493
It happens to me every day.
Didn't you see me get an earful last time?

00:07:52.577 --> 00:07:56.080
Mr. Gong can be so harsh
once he gets wound up.

00:07:56.163 --> 00:07:58.874
Yeah. Don't let it get to you, Nan-suk.

00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:01.627
I'm clearly at fault.

00:08:01.711 --> 00:08:04.255
I still can't even put together
a simple document.

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:06.465
Only if I could be more like you, Da-rim.

00:08:06.549 --> 00:08:08.384
Can you teach me later?

00:08:10.303 --> 00:08:11.220
Sure.

00:08:11.304 --> 00:08:12.763
I'd be happy to.

00:08:13.347 --> 00:08:15.016
I'm such a nuisance.

00:08:18.436 --> 00:08:20.313
Why would you say that?

00:08:20.896 --> 00:08:23.316
We all rely on you so much.

00:08:23.941 --> 00:08:25.026
Yeah, we do.

00:08:25.109 --> 00:08:27.028
-Me?
-Yeah.

00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:28.654
You've got great initiative.

00:08:28.738 --> 00:08:30.448
Think about the live commerce.

00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:32.533
Mr. Gong opposed it
because we lacked experience,

00:08:32.617 --> 00:08:34.785
but we ended up doing it
because you pushed for it.

00:08:34.869 --> 00:08:37.830
After that broadcast,
daily sales increased by ten times.

00:08:37.913 --> 00:08:41.167
There were a few twists and turns,
but ultimately, that's how it turned out.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.462
Everyone has their strengths
and weaknesses. Nobody's perfect.

00:08:44.545 --> 00:08:47.632
-I dare you to prove me wrong.
-She's right.

00:08:47.715 --> 00:08:49.008
-You think so?
-Of course.

00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:51.844
Mr. Gong can be a jerk sometimes,

00:08:51.927 --> 00:08:53.262
but we need to hang in there.

00:08:53.346 --> 00:08:54.347
Well said.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.850
Every company has a Mr. Gong.
Don't you agree?

00:08:57.933 --> 00:08:58.934
Oh my.

00:09:03.648 --> 00:09:06.192
Where am I, exactly?

00:09:06.275 --> 00:09:07.735
Well, you see…

00:09:08.819 --> 00:09:13.199
We were talking about how every company
needs someone like you.

00:09:13.282 --> 00:09:15.826
-All recharged? Let's get back to work.
-We'll get back to work.

00:09:17.078 --> 00:09:18.162
Ms. Go Da-rim.

00:09:18.788 --> 00:09:21.791
You'll come with me to pick out
gift bags during the exhibition.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.550
You care deeply for other people.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.178
Sorry?

00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:35.137
That was random.

00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:38.557
I heard you encouraging
your team members just now.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.144
You're able to say such things
because you take an interest

00:09:43.062 --> 00:09:44.522
and have affection for your colleagues.

00:09:46.148 --> 00:09:47.274
I'm sure

00:09:47.358 --> 00:09:50.361
you'll become a far greater leader
than I could ever be.

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:53.572
Thank you.

00:09:55.741 --> 00:09:57.118
That's why I like you.

00:09:58.077 --> 00:09:58.911
What?

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:12.466
Aren't you getting in?

00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:14.510
We have work to do.

00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:16.470
Right.

00:10:16.554 --> 00:10:19.056
We do.

00:10:27.273 --> 00:10:29.775
How about a hand wash and hand cream set?

00:10:30.317 --> 00:10:32.236
I think it'll be a safe choice
regardless of age.

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:33.195
That sounds good.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.825
I wonder how it smells. Let's test it.

00:10:43.706 --> 00:10:44.874
Hold on.

00:11:06.479 --> 00:11:10.357
Oh, that smells great,
and it goes on really nicely.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.651
You're proactive

00:11:13.235 --> 00:11:14.445
and always curious.

00:11:14.528 --> 00:11:17.448
Your willingness to check things
for yourself when you're curious

00:11:18.032 --> 00:11:19.283
is very admirable.

00:11:20.576 --> 00:11:23.579
Are you administering some sort of
aptitude and personality test today?

00:11:23.662 --> 00:11:25.956
Or a performance assessment?

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.166
No.

00:11:27.249 --> 00:11:29.001
I'm just telling you why I like you.

00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:34.340
We should check if there's enough
inventory in the warehouse.

00:11:37.426 --> 00:11:39.094
Where was it again?

00:11:41.347 --> 00:11:42.556
You take action.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.392
You always take a proactive approach
to problem-solving.

00:11:46.435 --> 00:11:48.187
That's why I like you.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.522
Mr. Gong.

00:11:49.605 --> 00:11:52.191
You've been acting strange
this whole time.

00:11:52.274 --> 00:11:53.776
Is this a new form of bullying?

00:11:53.859 --> 00:11:55.444
Drowning me in praise?

00:11:55.528 --> 00:11:57.488
You said I had no reason to like you.

00:11:58.197 --> 00:11:59.365
That's why I'm stating them.

00:11:59.865 --> 00:12:00.699
My reasons.

00:12:10.501 --> 00:12:11.544
TAEYU ART HALL
EXHIBITION PREPARATION IN PROGRESS

00:12:11.627 --> 00:12:14.213
I think we should add more leaves
at the top.

00:12:14.296 --> 00:12:15.130
Noted.

00:12:16.507 --> 00:12:17.633
Okay.

00:12:17.716 --> 00:12:19.843
In a little bit,

00:12:19.927 --> 00:12:22.096
let's try switching out

00:12:22.179 --> 00:12:24.431
the placement of the third photo

00:12:24.515 --> 00:12:26.600
and those photos on the left side.

00:12:26.684 --> 00:12:27.810
-Got it.
-Thank you.

00:12:29.603 --> 00:12:30.437
Mr. Kim.

00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:33.857
Why don't we take a short break?

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.734
Sure.

00:12:53.544 --> 00:12:55.129
Are you waiting to hear from Ms. Go?

00:12:59.675 --> 00:13:02.344
Are you just going to keep being anxious?

00:13:03.846 --> 00:13:04.763
I'm not anxious.

00:13:06.098 --> 00:13:07.224
I told her how I felt.

00:13:07.308 --> 00:13:08.601
No way. Really?

00:13:09.602 --> 00:13:10.686
Good for you!

00:13:10.769 --> 00:13:11.604
Just you wait.

00:13:11.687 --> 00:13:13.564
You'll hear good news soon.

00:13:14.982 --> 00:13:16.942
Good news?

00:13:17.026 --> 00:13:17.985
Yes.

00:13:18.068 --> 00:13:19.153
Rejection.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.366
Is that considered good news?

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:25.451
Of course.

00:13:25.534 --> 00:13:27.536
Just look at the state you're in now.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:31.081
You're suffering all alone,
unable to do anything.

00:13:31.165 --> 00:13:34.460
This handsome face
is growing older by the day.

00:13:34.543 --> 00:13:36.754
It's much better
to just confess your feelings,

00:13:36.837 --> 00:13:38.964
be flat-out rejected,
and give your mind a reset,

00:13:39.048 --> 00:13:40.257
so you can come to me.

00:13:40.341 --> 00:13:42.134
Just get shot down if it's inevitable

00:13:42.217 --> 00:13:43.927
and claim your new path in life.

00:13:44.762 --> 00:13:45.596
Well,

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.681
there's a chance

00:13:48.807 --> 00:13:50.100
she might not reject me.

00:13:50.684 --> 00:13:51.685
Come on now.

00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:54.563
I thought she was your friend.
Don't you know her better than that?

00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:57.149
She didn't strike me
as the intellectual type.

00:13:57.232 --> 00:13:58.942
Da-rim's smart.

00:13:59.026 --> 00:14:03.405
Yeah? Well, if she were so smart
and had such a discerning eye for men,

00:14:03.489 --> 00:14:05.282
would she just have
overlooked you all this time?

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.285
Only someone like me
would immediately recognize your worth.

00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:15.834
Excuse me, Ms. Lee.

00:14:15.918 --> 00:14:17.628
Are you done with the scissors?

00:14:20.422 --> 00:14:21.298
Thank you.

00:14:26.971 --> 00:14:30.140
There's something
I've wanted to ask you for a long time.

00:14:30.224 --> 00:14:32.893
What do the tattoos on your arm mean?

00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:37.648
My dad is the boss
of the Yongho Gang in Bulgye-dong.

00:14:38.148 --> 00:14:40.067
It's the gang's symbol,
so I got them done in middle school.

00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:41.902
He's the boss?

00:14:43.946 --> 00:14:44.863
I see.

00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:48.367
Ma'am.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.702
I mean, Ms. Lee.

00:14:50.327 --> 00:14:53.747
Please let me apologize in advance
if I ever made you uncomfortable

00:14:53.831 --> 00:14:55.124
during your time here.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.876
-I was kidding.
-What?

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.587
I burned myself while making
instant noodles a long time ago.

00:15:00.671 --> 00:15:03.048
I thought they'd scare Ji-yu,
so I covered them with tattoos.

00:15:03.132 --> 00:15:04.675
Oh, that's what they are?

00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:07.720
Ji-yu loves dragons and tigers.

00:15:08.512 --> 00:15:09.847
I even do puppet shows with them.

00:15:10.347 --> 00:15:13.142
"I won't eat you
if you give me a rice cake."

00:15:16.061 --> 00:15:18.022
-I guess your son is--
-Daughter.

00:15:18.105 --> 00:15:19.773
I guess your daughter takes after you.

00:15:22.359 --> 00:15:23.444
I appreciate you asking.

00:15:24.486 --> 00:15:25.320
Pardon?

00:15:25.404 --> 00:15:26.572
You're the first person

00:15:27.406 --> 00:15:28.449
to ask about them.

00:15:29.074 --> 00:15:30.993
Everyone notices them but pretends not to.

00:15:32.578 --> 00:15:35.831
All they see is a young mom with tattoos,

00:15:36.874 --> 00:15:39.877
so they never seem interested
in getting to know me.

00:15:41.503 --> 00:15:42.796
Don't be silly.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.008
I only asked
because I thought it was a bit strange

00:15:46.091 --> 00:15:48.635
to see someone cute like you
with such tattoos.

00:15:48.719 --> 00:15:52.806
So I thought there must be
some sort of meaningful story behind them.

00:15:53.432 --> 00:15:54.266
I'm cute?

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:55.934
Of course.

00:15:57.352 --> 00:15:58.562
That's not all.

00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:02.107
You're cool and smart.

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:04.109
And so much more.

00:16:09.615 --> 00:16:10.741
I should finish this.

00:16:11.909 --> 00:16:15.287
KANGKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

00:16:18.373 --> 00:16:20.626
Why stay at a friend's place
instead of mine?

00:16:22.002 --> 00:16:23.504
You haven't even known her that long.

00:16:24.671 --> 00:16:26.673
She's someone I can trust.

00:16:27.674 --> 00:16:30.469
I wouldn't be going through
with this divorce if it wasn't for her.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.513
How about you stay at a hotel?

00:16:32.596 --> 00:16:33.931
I'll book you the best one.

00:16:34.014 --> 00:16:37.017
I'll only be anxious in a hotel
or at your place.

00:16:37.726 --> 00:16:39.520
People will recognize me in no time.

00:16:40.312 --> 00:16:43.315
Just tell your father
that I'm traveling abroad.

00:16:43.398 --> 00:16:45.442
But it'll still be uncomfortable.

00:16:46.068 --> 00:16:50.322
Someone as sensitive as you
will only get hurt. This won't do.

00:16:52.324 --> 00:16:53.909
Mom, I'll just book you a hotel…

00:16:55.744 --> 00:16:56.662
Mom!

00:16:58.455 --> 00:17:00.249
Are you sure you told her
to meet you here?

00:17:00.332 --> 00:17:01.500
What's taking her so long?

00:17:01.583 --> 00:17:02.960
This is the spot.

00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:07.131
I'm sorry.

00:17:07.631 --> 00:17:09.091
We're a bit late, aren't we?

00:17:09.174 --> 00:17:11.135
No worries. We also just got here.

00:17:12.678 --> 00:17:13.595
Mom!

00:17:14.763 --> 00:17:15.597
Wait, Mom.

00:17:31.446 --> 00:17:32.614
Hold on a second.

00:17:32.698 --> 00:17:34.241
-Da-rim.
-Yeah?

00:17:34.324 --> 00:17:36.201
Isn't he your team leader?

00:17:36.285 --> 00:17:38.745
Yeah, he is.

00:17:38.829 --> 00:17:39.830
Mom.

00:17:40.497 --> 00:17:43.208
Is this the friend you're staying with?

00:17:44.001 --> 00:17:45.502
Yeah, she is.

00:17:47.212 --> 00:17:48.672
My goodness.

00:17:50.007 --> 00:17:50.966
Yes!

00:17:51.884 --> 00:17:54.178
I can't believe this.

00:17:56.388 --> 00:17:59.183
What are the chances?
It's nice to see you again.

00:17:59.266 --> 00:18:01.727
I'm glad to see
that you've recovered so quickly, Mother.

00:18:02.436 --> 00:18:03.854
"Mother"?

00:18:03.937 --> 00:18:07.482
Oh, does your daughter
work for our company?

00:18:08.025 --> 00:18:08.859
Yes.

00:18:08.942 --> 00:18:09.902
My goodness.

00:18:09.985 --> 00:18:13.488
I had no idea
she was working at your company.

00:18:13.572 --> 00:18:15.199
What a coincidence.

00:18:15.866 --> 00:18:17.743
-This is Da-rim?
-Yes.

00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:21.038
I've heard so much about you.

00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:24.249
Are you sure you won't feel uncomfortable
with me staying over?

00:18:24.333 --> 00:18:26.376
I'm worried our place might be too shabby.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.171
I just hope
you won't be too uncomfortable.

00:18:29.755 --> 00:18:31.715
There's no way she'd be.

00:18:31.798 --> 00:18:34.509
My mother isn't that sensitive a person.

00:18:35.093 --> 00:18:38.555
She'll find it much more comfortable
to stay with a friend

00:18:38.639 --> 00:18:39.556
than in a hotel alone.

00:18:42.434 --> 00:18:44.478
All right, shall we go?

00:18:49.691 --> 00:18:50.525
Welcome back.

00:18:51.401 --> 00:18:52.736
Hey.

00:18:52.819 --> 00:18:55.656
My baby, look at how much you've grown.

00:18:56.198 --> 00:18:57.032
Say hello.

00:18:57.115 --> 00:18:58.575
Hello.

00:18:58.659 --> 00:19:00.369
How adorable. Is he your grandson?

00:19:00.452 --> 00:19:01.370
That's his son.

00:19:01.954 --> 00:19:03.455
He's Da-rim's friend.

00:19:03.538 --> 00:19:04.748
He lives upstairs.

00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:06.917
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kim Seon-u.

00:19:07.542 --> 00:19:09.253
Nice to meet you.

00:19:09.836 --> 00:19:10.671
There they are.

00:19:10.754 --> 00:19:12.839
-You're back.
-Hey, Seon-u.

00:19:12.923 --> 00:19:14.841
Please excuse me.

00:19:16.176 --> 00:19:17.094
Mr. Gong?

00:19:18.011 --> 00:19:19.805
What are you doing here?

00:19:21.473 --> 00:19:23.392
It seems my mother and Da-rim's mother

00:19:23.475 --> 00:19:25.435
have become inseparable best friends.

00:19:26.436 --> 00:19:27.688
So here I am.

00:19:27.771 --> 00:19:29.439
Right.

00:19:30.023 --> 00:19:31.066
I see.

00:19:40.158 --> 00:19:41.410
My goodness.

00:19:41.493 --> 00:19:43.537
Seon-u, you made all this by yourself?

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.206
No, Jun helped me.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.499
-Right?
-Yes.

00:19:48.333 --> 00:19:50.002
Enjoy, Grandma.

00:19:50.085 --> 00:19:51.837
Thank you so much.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.588
I'll be sure to enjoy it.

00:19:53.672 --> 00:19:55.674
My goodness. Let's dig in.

00:19:55.757 --> 00:19:57.676
I don't even know where to start.

00:19:59.303 --> 00:20:01.555
I wonder what this is.

00:20:06.643 --> 00:20:08.103
Ma'am, have some meat.

00:20:10.147 --> 00:20:12.399
Thank you. That looks delicious.

00:20:13.442 --> 00:20:14.776
You're the best.

00:20:16.695 --> 00:20:17.696
Let's taste it.

00:20:19.448 --> 00:20:20.407
Mom.

00:20:26.121 --> 00:20:27.164
Have some meat.

00:20:28.832 --> 00:20:31.960
Be sure to have
some Pyogo mushrooms and anchovies too.

00:20:32.044 --> 00:20:33.295
They're good for healing bones.

00:20:35.547 --> 00:20:36.381
Thank you.

00:20:42.512 --> 00:20:43.347
It's delicious.

00:20:44.056 --> 00:20:45.515
The stir-fried glass noodles
are seasoned perfectly.

00:20:45.599 --> 00:20:47.768
I'm glad you like it.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:52.022
You're so polite, and you're a great cook.

00:20:52.647 --> 00:20:54.149
You don't see
a lot of young men like him nowadays.

00:20:54.232 --> 00:20:55.692
Absolutely.

00:20:55.776 --> 00:20:59.321
He's the perfect husband material.

00:20:59.404 --> 00:21:01.448
He's such a good father too.

00:21:01.531 --> 00:21:02.699
I'd love to have him as my son-in-law.

00:21:10.248 --> 00:21:11.625
Here, have some fruit.

00:21:13.794 --> 00:21:14.669
Why is it so hot?

00:21:16.254 --> 00:21:17.214
Slowly.

00:21:20.175 --> 00:21:21.760
Be careful.

00:21:24.096 --> 00:21:24.930
Should I do it?

00:21:27.891 --> 00:21:28.809
That looks good.

00:21:29.393 --> 00:21:30.477
My goodness.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.813
You even removed the seeds from the kiwi.

00:21:33.355 --> 00:21:34.523
There's one more.

00:21:41.905 --> 00:21:42.823
Hold on.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:44.449
Where are you going?

00:21:45.117 --> 00:21:46.743
You said you'd do it by yourself.

00:21:47.327 --> 00:21:48.620
But can't you keep me company?

00:21:49.246 --> 00:21:50.080
I'm bored.

00:21:50.163 --> 00:21:52.457
Come on. How can you be bored
when you're doing the dishes?

00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:55.168
Then can you brush my hair aside for me?
They keep poking my eyes.

00:21:55.794 --> 00:21:58.171
Right here. Right above my eyes.

00:21:58.255 --> 00:22:00.048
Okay, one second.

00:22:16.606 --> 00:22:17.691
Da-rim.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.277
Do you know how pretty you are?

00:22:20.944 --> 00:22:21.778
What?

00:22:23.113 --> 00:22:24.698
What's with you again?

00:22:24.781 --> 00:22:26.158
That's another reason I like you.

00:22:27.242 --> 00:22:28.326
You're pretty.

00:22:33.373 --> 00:22:34.666
I just thought you should know.

00:22:36.918 --> 00:22:38.712
How can you say things like that out loud?

00:22:38.795 --> 00:22:40.672
What if someone hears you?

00:22:40.755 --> 00:22:41.798
Who cares?

00:22:41.882 --> 00:22:44.009
How can you not care?
They could get the wrong idea.

00:22:44.092 --> 00:22:45.177
There's no one around.

00:22:46.678 --> 00:22:47.637
Sorry.

00:22:47.721 --> 00:22:49.431
Move aside.

00:22:49.514 --> 00:22:52.684
Lower your voice. What's wrong with you?

00:22:52.767 --> 00:22:55.645
-You're just really pretty.
-Be quiet, seriously!

00:22:55.729 --> 00:22:58.607
-There's no one around.
-Yes, there is!

00:23:03.445 --> 00:23:04.863
Why isn't he leaving?

00:23:04.946 --> 00:23:06.072
It's so late.

00:23:07.073 --> 00:23:08.408
I can throw them out.

00:23:08.491 --> 00:23:09.868
Just let me take one.

00:23:09.951 --> 00:23:12.120
-Don't worry. I'm strong.
-Wait. Just let me.

00:23:12.204 --> 00:23:13.830
-Wait.
-Why those two…

00:23:13.914 --> 00:23:16.249
-I told you I'd do it.
-Stop. Hold on.

00:23:16.333 --> 00:23:17.876
You don't have to do all this.

00:23:17.959 --> 00:23:19.294
It's my duty as a son.

00:23:19.377 --> 00:23:22.339
You're doing my mother a favor.
This is the least I could do.

00:23:30.555 --> 00:23:32.807
It's getting late. You should head home.

00:23:32.891 --> 00:23:34.100
I can take care of this.

00:23:34.184 --> 00:23:36.102
Give it. I'll do it.

00:23:36.186 --> 00:23:37.312
Wait…

00:23:37.395 --> 00:23:38.355
No.

00:23:38.438 --> 00:23:39.648
I'll do it.

00:23:39.731 --> 00:23:41.024
I'll do it.

00:23:41.107 --> 00:23:42.442
-I'll do it.
-Hold on.

00:23:42.525 --> 00:23:43.526
Wait. Stop.

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:44.694
I'll do it…

00:23:57.374 --> 00:24:00.835
-What are we going to do now?
-Hold on.

00:24:02.504 --> 00:24:04.965
I guess they were separated.
These are all cans.

00:24:05.048 --> 00:24:07.842
Someone just had to rip the bag.

00:24:09.302 --> 00:24:10.804
Oh, right. Light bulb.

00:24:10.887 --> 00:24:13.223
-What?
-Do you have an extra at your place?

00:24:13.306 --> 00:24:15.350
I don't think
I have any spare light bulbs.

00:24:15.433 --> 00:24:16.768
I can just go buy one now.

00:24:16.851 --> 00:24:18.979
I'll get you the brightest one
while I'm at it.

00:24:19.062 --> 00:24:19.980
It's too dark in there.

00:24:20.772 --> 00:24:22.565
-I'll go buy it.
-What?

00:24:23.441 --> 00:24:24.985
I'll get you the brightest one.

00:24:25.068 --> 00:24:26.861
-Okay!
-Wait, Mr. Gong!

00:24:26.945 --> 00:24:28.530
-You don't…
-I was going to get it.

00:24:41.376 --> 00:24:42.460
All done.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:48.091
The lights are all set.

00:24:49.634 --> 00:24:50.844
Nice and bright, right?

00:24:53.346 --> 00:24:56.474
Who hangs something like that
in a bathroom?

00:24:56.558 --> 00:24:58.435
I know, right?

00:24:59.102 --> 00:25:00.312
It's like a department store.

00:25:01.563 --> 00:25:04.733
That's going to use up more electricity
than the fridge.

00:25:10.697 --> 00:25:12.699
-Go. Hurry.
-Hold on a second.

00:25:13.575 --> 00:25:15.160
It's not that I don't want to leave.

00:25:15.243 --> 00:25:17.746
My mother's staying here,
and I have a duty as a son to--

00:25:17.829 --> 00:25:19.539
There's no room for you to sleep in.

00:25:19.622 --> 00:25:21.333
Go home and sleep comfortably.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.043
-Mom!
-Wait.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.045
Should I leave?

00:25:26.671 --> 00:25:27.589
She says no.

00:25:27.672 --> 00:25:29.299
Pick up your phone.

00:25:32.844 --> 00:25:33.720
What is it?

00:25:36.097 --> 00:25:37.640
What a witty illustration.

00:25:43.396 --> 00:25:45.065
-So cute.
-Hey.

00:25:45.148 --> 00:25:46.399
-So adorable.
-Hey!

00:25:47.442 --> 00:25:48.526
You're here.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:50.362
What has you so distracted?

00:25:51.112 --> 00:25:53.198
Who calls for advice at this hour?

00:25:53.782 --> 00:25:54.949
I was in the middle
of something important.

00:25:55.033 --> 00:25:55.867
Ji-hyeok.

00:25:56.576 --> 00:25:58.119
You know that woman you met in Jeju?

00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:59.913
Yeah, what about her?

00:25:59.996 --> 00:26:01.331
Are you going to pursue her?

00:26:01.414 --> 00:26:02.332
What, you're strongly against it?

00:26:04.084 --> 00:26:05.919
Do what your heart tells you.

00:26:06.002 --> 00:26:07.754
When it comes to love,

00:26:08.338 --> 00:26:10.882
your head will come up
with dozens of reasons to object,

00:26:10.965 --> 00:26:13.259
but once the heartstrings are pulled,

00:26:13.343 --> 00:26:15.136
you're helpless.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.304
Like these guys.

00:26:16.388 --> 00:26:20.016
Once you press the start button,
you can't stop in the middle.

00:26:20.767 --> 00:26:22.602
Not until they go through the cycles

00:26:22.685 --> 00:26:24.562
and stop on their own.

00:26:24.646 --> 00:26:25.855
Do you have a crush on someone?

00:26:25.939 --> 00:26:27.148
I think so.

00:26:27.232 --> 00:26:28.608
Why is your head telling you no?

00:26:29.943 --> 00:26:30.902
Well,

00:26:32.237 --> 00:26:33.863
she works at our company.

00:26:35.115 --> 00:26:38.326
I know you're against office romances.

00:26:38.952 --> 00:26:40.453
What's wrong with an office romance?

00:26:41.037 --> 00:26:42.247
I think it's great.

00:26:42.831 --> 00:26:43.665
You do?

00:26:43.748 --> 00:26:44.958
Of course.

00:26:45.041 --> 00:26:48.211
Hey, when you work closely with someone,

00:26:48.294 --> 00:26:51.923
it's only natural for friendship to form
and feelings to develop.

00:26:52.006 --> 00:26:53.842
That's not something that can be stopped.

00:26:53.925 --> 00:26:56.386
No, it certainly can't be stopped.

00:26:57.011 --> 00:27:00.223
I just don't know what to do,
seeing the most adorable and pretty woman

00:27:00.306 --> 00:27:01.766
in front of me all the time.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.017
Hold on. Stop.

00:27:05.186 --> 00:27:07.897
"The most adorable and pretty woman"?

00:27:07.981 --> 00:27:09.691
-Yes.
-By any chance…

00:27:09.774 --> 00:27:10.775
Yes.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:13.945
-Go…
-Go?

00:27:14.028 --> 00:27:15.447
-Go.
-Go?

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.323
-Go.
-Go?

00:27:17.407 --> 00:27:18.575
Go--

00:27:21.619 --> 00:27:23.288
No, absolutely not.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:25.457
You can't go for her!

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:26.833
Why not?

00:27:26.916 --> 00:27:29.002
You just said it was okay.

00:27:29.085 --> 00:27:31.212
Is it because Go-eun is on our team?

00:27:36.551 --> 00:27:37.802
You were talking about Go-eun?

00:27:38.386 --> 00:27:39.679
Yeah.

00:27:39.762 --> 00:27:40.972
So it was Go-eun.

00:27:41.055 --> 00:27:44.267
She's great. You'd make a cute couple.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:45.226
Your laundry is done.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:46.227
Take it out.

00:27:50.273 --> 00:27:51.357
What's wrong with him?

00:27:51.441 --> 00:27:52.525
MARKET AND COMPETITION ANALYSIS REPORT

00:27:52.609 --> 00:27:55.820
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

00:27:55.904 --> 00:27:58.823
I didn't mean to tell him.

00:27:58.907 --> 00:28:02.076
He made it sound like
he had already talked it over with you.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:02.994
So you're saying

00:28:03.077 --> 00:28:05.788
he poked you once
and you just gave it all away

00:28:07.165 --> 00:28:08.750
without a second thought, right?

00:28:12.837 --> 00:28:13.671
Mr. Ma.

00:28:14.339 --> 00:28:17.008
I gave you that job because you were
perceptive despite being incompetent,

00:28:17.091 --> 00:28:19.010
but if you keep disappointing me
like this,

00:28:19.093 --> 00:28:21.429
-you leave me no choice but to--
-Ma'am, please forgive me.

00:28:21.513 --> 00:28:23.681
I swear this will never happen again.

00:28:23.765 --> 00:28:25.391
I swear on my and my family's honor

00:28:25.475 --> 00:28:28.186
that something like this
will never happen again.

00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:29.604
I'll make sure of it.

00:28:32.565 --> 00:28:33.900
Who cares about family?

00:28:35.693 --> 00:28:38.404
You don't need to be on your knees.
Just sit down.

00:28:39.155 --> 00:28:39.989
Yes, ma'am.

00:28:42.242 --> 00:28:47.205
I realized this time
how cunning and sly that Yu Tae-yeong is.

00:28:47.288 --> 00:28:49.415
You should stop associating with him.

00:28:49.499 --> 00:28:51.292
Let's stick together and…

00:28:54.838 --> 00:28:56.881
It's as if he knows
we're talking about him.

00:28:56.965 --> 00:28:59.092
Look at him calling.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.553
You may leave.

00:29:07.767 --> 00:29:09.435
YU TAE-YEONG

00:29:15.775 --> 00:29:17.026
They were so playful.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.029
They had so much fun together.

00:29:20.113 --> 00:29:21.406
Look at Da-rim.

00:29:23.199 --> 00:29:26.536
This is when Da-rim
went to Jirisan in elementary school.

00:29:26.619 --> 00:29:28.246
She was whining about her legs hurting,

00:29:28.329 --> 00:29:29.831
so her dad carried her
all the way to the top.

00:29:29.914 --> 00:29:31.124
To the top of the mountain?

00:29:31.207 --> 00:29:32.500
My goodness.

00:29:32.584 --> 00:29:33.710
Look at this.

00:29:33.793 --> 00:29:37.171
Every birthday, our house used to be
covered in whipped cream.

00:29:37.755 --> 00:29:40.466
Your family looks so happy.

00:29:41.217 --> 00:29:43.094
My husband was a taxi driver.

00:29:43.887 --> 00:29:45.513
They didn't get
the most affluent upbringing,

00:29:45.597 --> 00:29:49.225
but he took them on countless road trips
across the country for sightseeing

00:29:49.309 --> 00:29:50.852
on his days off.

00:29:53.855 --> 00:29:55.732
Our family got along really well.

00:29:56.441 --> 00:29:58.151
This is Da-rim again.

00:29:58.234 --> 00:30:00.028
What are you all looking at?

00:30:00.737 --> 00:30:01.571
Mom!

00:30:01.654 --> 00:30:03.698
Why would you show them this?

00:30:03.781 --> 00:30:06.784
I was showing them
because In-ae was curious.

00:30:08.953 --> 00:30:11.581
This is basically a collection
of my most embarrassing moments.

00:30:11.664 --> 00:30:14.208
No, it's not. You were adorable.

00:30:14.876 --> 00:30:18.546
I should've taken Ji-hyeok
on outings and trips

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:21.424
when he was a kid.

00:30:22.091 --> 00:30:24.427
But I couldn't
because I was always in the hospital.

00:30:25.011 --> 00:30:26.763
Why would you say that?

00:30:34.646 --> 00:30:38.191
Why don't we go on an outing now?

00:30:38.274 --> 00:30:39.150
The weather's so nice.

00:30:39.233 --> 00:30:40.360
Now?

00:30:40.443 --> 00:30:41.486
Yes.

00:30:41.569 --> 00:30:43.821
We just need to pack some food
and a picnic blanket.

00:30:44.822 --> 00:30:46.991
How does that sound? What do you say?

00:30:47.075 --> 00:30:48.242
-I'm in.
-You're in.

00:30:48.326 --> 00:30:49.786
-Let's go.
-All right.

00:30:50.453 --> 00:30:51.829
-Great.
-This is going to be so fun.

00:30:52.455 --> 00:30:53.373
Let's do it.

00:30:58.002 --> 00:30:59.712
What a pretty park.

00:30:59.796 --> 00:31:01.965
Did you really build it?

00:31:02.882 --> 00:31:05.385
It wasn't me. Our company did.

00:31:06.803 --> 00:31:09.472
If it wasn't for you,
they would've never built it,

00:31:09.555 --> 00:31:10.932
so it's only right that you take credit.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:14.394
I'm going to start coming here often.

00:31:14.477 --> 00:31:16.145
-Then, I'll--
-I will!

00:31:17.939 --> 00:31:19.107
I'll bring you here often.

00:31:19.732 --> 00:31:23.236
They say walking in nature like this
is excellent for your health.

00:31:23.945 --> 00:31:27.699
As expected, you're the only one
who truly cares about me, Seon-u.

00:31:31.744 --> 00:31:32.578
Hey.

00:31:34.038 --> 00:31:35.540
Doesn't Jun need to go to academies?

00:31:35.623 --> 00:31:37.875
I heard kids are really busy nowadays.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.045
Even daycares are closed on Sundays.

00:31:46.467 --> 00:31:47.677
Everyone.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.928
You must all be thirsty.

00:31:49.012 --> 00:31:50.805
-I'll--
-I'll go get some drinks!

00:31:52.849 --> 00:31:55.393
You can go ahead
and relax under that tree over there.

00:31:55.476 --> 00:31:57.061
I'll be back with some drinks soon.

00:31:57.145 --> 00:31:58.396
Where? That tree?

00:31:58.479 --> 00:31:59.897
Yes, under that tree right there.

00:31:59.981 --> 00:32:01.649
No, hold on.

00:32:01.733 --> 00:32:03.484
I'll get the drinks.

00:32:04.402 --> 00:32:05.695
I'll get them.

00:32:05.778 --> 00:32:07.739
It's our park,
so it's only right that I buy them.

00:32:07.822 --> 00:32:08.906
Do you even know
what Da-rim's mother likes?

00:32:10.116 --> 00:32:11.492
The one who knows should get them.

00:32:15.997 --> 00:32:17.248
Don't fight.

00:32:18.166 --> 00:32:19.959
Why don't you play a game for it?

00:32:20.043 --> 00:32:21.669
The winner gets to go.

00:32:46.152 --> 00:32:47.361
Two to two.

00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:49.781
Kim Seon-u's serve.

00:33:05.963 --> 00:33:06.964
What's gotten into them?

00:33:08.257 --> 00:33:09.634
Are they training for the Olympics?

00:33:09.717 --> 00:33:10.843
Tell me about it.

00:33:36.369 --> 00:33:37.328
Excuse me.

00:33:37.411 --> 00:33:38.496
It's my serve.

00:33:39.288 --> 00:33:41.707
-Hand it over.
-It was out. It's my serve.

00:33:41.791 --> 00:33:44.043
It was in. It was inside the line.

00:33:44.127 --> 00:33:46.045
It was out. Don't play dirty.

00:33:46.129 --> 00:33:47.171
It was in. It's my serve!

00:33:47.255 --> 00:33:48.506
It was out. It's my serve!

00:33:48.589 --> 00:33:49.549
-In!
-Out!

00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.225
Ta-da!

00:33:59.725 --> 00:34:01.811
Cinnamon punch and rice punch
for the mothers.

00:34:02.395 --> 00:34:04.355
And banana milk for Jun.

00:34:05.189 --> 00:34:06.983
Herbal tea for you, right?

00:34:07.066 --> 00:34:08.317
-Yeah. Thank you.
-No problem.

00:34:08.401 --> 00:34:09.277
Ji-hyeok.

00:34:09.944 --> 00:34:10.903
Don't you want a drink?

00:34:13.614 --> 00:34:14.824
I'm not thirsty.

00:34:16.617 --> 00:34:18.911
Are you sure? Your lips look very dry.

00:34:24.333 --> 00:34:26.210
Oh, you know,

00:34:26.794 --> 00:34:30.256
Ji-hyeok is really good at sports too.

00:34:31.007 --> 00:34:33.551
He even won a taekwondo competition
when he was a kid.

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:36.762
Wow, he did?

00:34:36.846 --> 00:34:37.805
That reminds me.

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:40.266
Seon-u competed in
all sorts of competitions as well.

00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:43.352
He was on the badminton team
in middle school.

00:34:43.436 --> 00:34:45.897
I believe he placed third in nationals.

00:34:46.856 --> 00:34:47.773
Second.

00:34:47.857 --> 00:34:49.775
-Yeah, you placed second.
-Oh, right.

00:34:50.735 --> 00:34:51.611
Seriously?

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:53.571
You were a former athlete?

00:34:54.864 --> 00:34:58.743
How could a former athlete
go all out against an amateur?

00:34:59.327 --> 00:35:00.494
You don't have any manners, do you?

00:35:00.578 --> 00:35:02.622
How unbelievable.

00:35:02.705 --> 00:35:05.750
I would've totally won
if we had done taekwondo.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:08.419
Of course.

00:35:15.384 --> 00:35:17.053
Your wife went on a trip?

00:35:18.679 --> 00:35:21.015
I thought she was still recovering.

00:35:22.225 --> 00:35:25.353
That's why she went to Switzerland
to recuperate.

00:35:26.229 --> 00:35:29.774
Does she not want her son to get married?

00:35:30.942 --> 00:35:32.902
I mean, we're in no rush.

00:35:32.985 --> 00:35:35.029
I sincerely apologize for everything.

00:35:35.821 --> 00:35:37.949
We'll set a date
as soon as my wife returns.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.035
This is making me rather anxious.

00:35:41.118 --> 00:35:43.913
What are you going to do
about Ji-hyeok's position?

00:35:44.455 --> 00:35:48.084
Surely you won't let him get married
with just a team leader title.

00:35:48.167 --> 00:35:49.293
Of course not.

00:35:49.377 --> 00:35:52.338
He'll be promoted to vice president soon.
Don't worry.

00:35:53.381 --> 00:35:54.590
Father.

00:35:54.674 --> 00:35:55.758
Vice president?

00:35:57.426 --> 00:36:00.930
The board members will strongly oppose
such a sudden promotion.

00:36:01.013 --> 00:36:03.391
Who would dare oppose me
when I'm trying to properly train my son?

00:36:04.308 --> 00:36:06.477
He's going to do great things,
so his title should reflect that.

00:36:08.938 --> 00:36:10.398
Your father's right.

00:36:11.524 --> 00:36:12.400
Yes.

00:36:22.285 --> 00:36:24.412
You said you'd help me stop
Ji-hyeok and Ha-yeong's wedding.

00:36:25.705 --> 00:36:27.248
First, I need to know why.

00:36:27.331 --> 00:36:30.209
How could you go straight into work talk
without any small talk first?

00:36:31.085 --> 00:36:33.504
I even ordered single malt, your favorite.

00:36:35.006 --> 00:36:35.965
Neat, right?

00:36:46.475 --> 00:36:47.476
Gutsy.

00:36:50.104 --> 00:36:51.022
So tell me.

00:36:52.023 --> 00:36:52.982
What are you thinking?

00:36:54.692 --> 00:36:55.818
Money.

00:36:55.901 --> 00:36:57.820
I'm just trying to make some money.
What else?

00:36:57.903 --> 00:36:59.113
I'm a single-minded guy.

00:36:59.196 --> 00:37:01.282
Breaking off the marriage
is just a side thing.

00:37:02.074 --> 00:37:02.992
Natural BeBe.

00:37:04.076 --> 00:37:05.578
I'll make sure it becomes yours.

00:37:06.662 --> 00:37:07.705
How?

00:37:09.999 --> 00:37:12.376
Gong Chang-ho. Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:37:13.377 --> 00:37:14.503
We just have to push both of them out.

00:37:17.131 --> 00:37:18.341
So how, exactly?

00:37:18.966 --> 00:37:22.136
I'm actually one of Natural BeBe's
major shareholders.

00:37:22.219 --> 00:37:23.554
What? You are?

00:37:23.637 --> 00:37:25.181
Recently, your company carried out

00:37:25.264 --> 00:37:27.600
a paid-in capital increase
to secure funds for overseas expansion.

00:37:27.683 --> 00:37:28.976
I bought all of it.

00:37:30.102 --> 00:37:32.021
If we pool our shares,

00:37:32.104 --> 00:37:34.315
it should be about the same
as Chairman Gong's.

00:37:35.066 --> 00:37:35.983
No.

00:37:36.817 --> 00:37:38.069
That won't be enough.

00:37:38.736 --> 00:37:40.780
A motion to dismiss the chairman could be
brought to the shareholders' meeting,

00:37:40.863 --> 00:37:42.198
but to make it pass,

00:37:43.032 --> 00:37:45.076
we'd also need votes
from the minority shareholders.

00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:46.702
But why would they go out of their way

00:37:47.244 --> 00:37:48.412
to change leadership?

00:37:50.915 --> 00:37:53.751
That's why your role is important.

00:37:54.377 --> 00:37:57.421
For ten years, you've been the successor
who handled the actual operations

00:37:57.505 --> 00:37:58.964
and the one who knows…

00:38:00.883 --> 00:38:03.135
all about Chairman Gong's weaknesses.

00:38:03.219 --> 00:38:05.096
Are you telling me
to go against my father?

00:38:05.846 --> 00:38:06.806
Publicly, at that?

00:38:07.723 --> 00:38:08.808
Then I'll…

00:38:08.891 --> 00:38:13.646
No. We, the investors,
will appoint you the new CEO,

00:38:14.188 --> 00:38:15.523
and in exchange,

00:38:15.606 --> 00:38:18.609
all you need to do
is provide our fund a generous dividend.

00:38:20.694 --> 00:38:21.737
What about your father?

00:38:23.364 --> 00:38:25.241
Do you think
he'll just sit back and watch?

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:31.539
My father's even more single-minded
than I am.

00:38:31.622 --> 00:38:34.250
Nothing else matters
as long as he makes money.

00:38:34.333 --> 00:38:37.420
He can marry off Ha-yeong
to another family.

00:38:38.254 --> 00:38:40.005
This will probably make him happier.

00:38:43.092 --> 00:38:44.343
That does make sense.

00:38:49.056 --> 00:38:51.267
But how can I trust you?

00:38:52.351 --> 00:38:54.437
Why? Do you think I'm messing with you?

00:38:55.896 --> 00:38:56.897
Then,

00:38:57.481 --> 00:38:58.774
I guess

00:38:59.358 --> 00:39:00.776
I have to show you I'm serious.

00:39:03.529 --> 00:39:04.530
Soon.

00:39:18.711 --> 00:39:19.795
Wow, this looks so good.

00:39:19.879 --> 00:39:21.755
He ordered so much.

00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:23.716
You're the best, mister!

00:39:23.799 --> 00:39:25.050
Eat up.

00:39:25.134 --> 00:39:27.470
But Jun, you should just call me Ji-hyeok.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:28.888
Okay.

00:39:28.971 --> 00:39:30.723
Having him call you by your name
is a bit of a stretch, no?

00:39:30.806 --> 00:39:32.892
Jun, just call him Uncle Ji-hyeok.

00:39:32.975 --> 00:39:34.143
Why?

00:39:34.226 --> 00:39:35.686
You can call handsome guys
by their names, okay?

00:39:35.769 --> 00:39:39.565
I don't think you're handsome enough
to call yourself that.

00:39:40.149 --> 00:39:41.150
So you do find me handsome.

00:39:41.233 --> 00:39:42.943
No, that's not exactly what I meant.

00:39:43.027 --> 00:39:44.361
-Ma'am.
-Yeah?

00:39:44.445 --> 00:39:45.779
Can you pour me a drink?

00:39:45.863 --> 00:39:49.241
Of course, we need to have a drink
on a day like this.

00:39:49.325 --> 00:39:51.785
We can't,
so you should drink on our behalf.

00:39:51.869 --> 00:39:53.204
Just leave it to me.

00:39:58.959 --> 00:40:00.461
You should drink slowly.

00:40:00.544 --> 00:40:01.670
I'm fine.

00:40:01.754 --> 00:40:02.588
Are you sure?

00:40:03.214 --> 00:40:04.715
-Are you?
-It's nice and sweet.

00:40:04.798 --> 00:40:07.134
Just watching him drink
is lifting my spirits.

00:40:07.718 --> 00:40:09.887
-Can you pour me one as well?
-Wait.

00:40:13.557 --> 00:40:15.142
-In that glass?
-Yes.

00:40:15.768 --> 00:40:16.602
I'll drink on your behalf.

00:40:23.067 --> 00:40:24.109
How exciting.

00:40:25.736 --> 00:40:27.905
CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE STATUS
NAME: KIM IN-AE

00:40:27.988 --> 00:40:31.408
CERTIFICATE OF FAMILY RELATIONS
NAME: KIM IN-AE

00:40:38.207 --> 00:40:39.041
Come in.

00:40:47.007 --> 00:40:48.926
I could've gotten it myself.

00:40:50.886 --> 00:40:51.929
Thank you.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.559
That's a lot of medicine.

00:41:00.854 --> 00:41:02.314
There are sleeping pills

00:41:02.856 --> 00:41:05.568
and some psychiatric medication as well.

00:41:05.651 --> 00:41:06.485
I see.

00:41:07.152 --> 00:41:10.364
Could you keep me company for a bit?

00:41:12.491 --> 00:41:16.287
That's why I stopped that marriage.

00:41:17.371 --> 00:41:18.664
I wanted Ji-hyeok

00:41:19.623 --> 00:41:21.125
to live a happy life

00:41:22.001 --> 00:41:24.003
with the person he loves.

00:41:25.087 --> 00:41:26.213
I had no idea

00:41:27.673 --> 00:41:30.384
that Mr. Gong had such a past.

00:41:31.343 --> 00:41:34.972
It's been such a long time
since I've seen Ji-hyeok

00:41:35.055 --> 00:41:36.765
whining and showing off like a kid.

00:41:37.391 --> 00:41:41.103
He had no choice
but to grow up quickly because of me.

00:41:42.187 --> 00:41:43.772
He's always been mature

00:41:44.398 --> 00:41:46.442
and swallowed all his feelings.

00:41:47.234 --> 00:41:49.612
He's mature?

00:41:50.195 --> 00:41:51.238
Why?

00:41:52.031 --> 00:41:54.617
I guess he acts quite differently
when he's around you.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.118
No, it's just that

00:41:56.201 --> 00:42:00.289
I can easily see
what he's feeling in the moment.

00:42:00.372 --> 00:42:03.250
Sometimes, he actually seems to
display his feelings on purpose.

00:42:04.168 --> 00:42:08.672
It must be because he's attracted
to your bright energy.

00:42:09.506 --> 00:42:10.883
I'm not bright at all.

00:42:10.966 --> 00:42:12.926
I can't even see two steps ahead.

00:42:20.726 --> 00:42:22.144
The bright energy

00:42:22.978 --> 00:42:25.939
of someone who grew up
with a loving family like yours

00:42:27.566 --> 00:42:29.026
emanates from within.

00:42:30.611 --> 00:42:32.696
You might not see it,

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.740
but it's crystal clear

00:42:35.324 --> 00:42:37.701
to someone like me or Ji-hyeok

00:42:38.535 --> 00:42:40.204
who has been hurt by love.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.833
The strong and warm energy.

00:42:47.044 --> 00:42:51.006
That's why whenever we come across it,
we can't help but admire it

00:42:51.757 --> 00:42:53.050
and be drawn to it.

00:42:57.805 --> 00:42:59.807
I hope you'll continue

00:43:00.391 --> 00:43:03.519
to get along well with Ji-hyeok.

00:43:16.615 --> 00:43:19.993
Gosh, here you are working your tail off,
while I'm living in the lap of luxury.

00:43:20.577 --> 00:43:22.079
Oh, is In-ae sleeping?

00:43:22.955 --> 00:43:23.789
Not yet.

00:43:23.872 --> 00:43:25.749
She was looking at some documents.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.211
She's been through a lot as well.

00:43:29.753 --> 00:43:31.839
I don't know how she survived
all those years.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.510
But you know,
she did such a good job raising her son.

00:43:36.593 --> 00:43:37.886
He's so handsome.

00:43:39.179 --> 00:43:41.932
He's just like your dad when he was young.

00:43:45.102 --> 00:43:45.936
Mom.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.021
What did Dad say to you

00:43:48.564 --> 00:43:51.275
when he told you that he liked you?

00:43:51.942 --> 00:43:53.652
Why? Did someone say they like you?

00:43:53.736 --> 00:43:55.237
No, it's just a thought that popped up

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.406
when we were looking
at the photo album earlier.

00:43:58.407 --> 00:43:59.533
When someone tells you that they like you,

00:44:00.284 --> 00:44:02.870
is there a way to tell

00:44:02.953 --> 00:44:04.872
whether they're being genuine or not?

00:44:05.831 --> 00:44:07.166
What a silly thing to wonder.

00:44:09.752 --> 00:44:12.212
Your dad never confessed
his feelings for me.

00:44:12.296 --> 00:44:13.255
Really?

00:44:13.756 --> 00:44:15.257
Then how did you start dating?

00:44:15.841 --> 00:44:17.384
He just kept showing up.

00:44:19.136 --> 00:44:21.555
He never once asked me out,

00:44:21.638 --> 00:44:24.349
but whenever I found myself in trouble,

00:44:24.433 --> 00:44:27.436
he would just show up out of nowhere
and help me out.

00:44:28.145 --> 00:44:31.356
As that kept happening,

00:44:31.899 --> 00:44:33.192
I just came to realize it.

00:44:33.275 --> 00:44:36.278
"He likes me."

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:39.615
I see.

00:44:41.116 --> 00:44:43.994
To figure someone out, watch how they act,

00:44:44.495 --> 00:44:46.121
not what they say.

00:44:46.205 --> 00:44:47.748
Then you'll know

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:49.833
whether they're being genuine or not.

00:45:12.147 --> 00:45:13.357
It's warm.

00:45:17.319 --> 00:45:20.239
Watch how they act?

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.324
Go Da-rim!

00:45:22.407 --> 00:45:23.367
Come out!

00:45:31.667 --> 00:45:32.626
Thank goodness.

00:45:44.137 --> 00:45:46.265
Liver, pancreas, lungs.

00:45:46.848 --> 00:45:48.141
Which should we sell first?

00:45:50.852 --> 00:45:51.770
Let me buy them off you.

00:45:52.354 --> 00:45:53.313
Do you take credit?

00:45:55.566 --> 00:45:56.400
LOVE PORRIDGE

00:45:56.942 --> 00:45:57.901
What's this?

00:45:57.985 --> 00:45:59.611
I'm allergic to abalones,

00:46:00.445 --> 00:46:01.822
but I couldn't waste perfectly good food.

00:46:01.905 --> 00:46:03.615
They were half price
at the shop out front.

00:46:04.324 --> 00:46:05.284
Just the ginger tea.

00:46:05.367 --> 00:46:06.743
You said you had gastritis.

00:46:07.244 --> 00:46:09.746
I need to have a drink on a day like this.

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:11.248
Then you should
at least eat something first.

00:46:13.375 --> 00:46:15.419
You always mess up,
get hurt, and fall ill.

00:46:15.502 --> 00:46:17.129
Can't you get your act together?

00:46:18.297 --> 00:46:19.256
Are you feeling sick?

00:46:22.884 --> 00:46:23.927
Ms. Go Da-rim?

00:46:24.011 --> 00:46:25.804
Da-rim. Ms. Go.

00:46:25.887 --> 00:46:26.763
Da-rim.

00:46:26.847 --> 00:46:28.557
Da-rim.

00:46:32.352 --> 00:46:35.105
To figure someone out, watch how they act,

00:46:35.689 --> 00:46:37.274
not what they say.

00:46:49.411 --> 00:46:52.372
That's why I like you.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.071
A GREEN FUTURE WE DRAW TOGETHER
PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION

00:47:31.536 --> 00:47:32.913
In this section,

00:47:32.996 --> 00:47:35.582
we combined purple
and light blue butterflies

00:47:35.666 --> 00:47:38.085
to portray the harmony of nature.

00:47:38.168 --> 00:47:41.922
We focused on how their expressions
changed depending on the environment.

00:47:42.506 --> 00:47:44.091
You can use this to take them.

00:47:44.174 --> 00:47:46.259
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.136
-You can use this.
-Thanks.

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.262
Enjoy.

00:47:49.346 --> 00:47:51.181
Thank you for coming.

00:47:51.264 --> 00:47:52.933
Enjoy.

00:47:53.517 --> 00:47:54.851
Hello, please take this with you.

00:47:54.935 --> 00:47:56.311
Please take one.

00:47:56.395 --> 00:47:57.521
Thank you for coming.

00:47:57.604 --> 00:47:58.563
-Here you go.
-I enjoyed the exhibition.

00:47:58.647 --> 00:47:59.648
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:47:59.731 --> 00:48:00.607
Here you go.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.235
Enjoy the exhibition. Thank you.

00:48:03.318 --> 00:48:04.277
Here you go.

00:48:04.778 --> 00:48:06.947
Enjoy the exhibition. Thank you.

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.533
It's so nice to see you
working on such a big project together

00:48:09.616 --> 00:48:11.326
before you walk down the aisle.

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:14.830
Ji-hyeok has been such a huge help.

00:48:14.913 --> 00:48:16.123
Thank you for your kind words.

00:48:16.206 --> 00:48:18.667
I was worried because I didn't recognize
the photographer's name,

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:20.043
but his pieces are great.

00:48:20.127 --> 00:48:22.045
Aren't they? His name is Kim Seon-u.

00:48:22.129 --> 00:48:23.380
-He's a hidden gem I discovered.
-Hello.

00:48:23.463 --> 00:48:25.382
-I'll set up a meeting later.
-Thank you.

00:48:26.383 --> 00:48:27.592
Let's go.

00:48:31.471 --> 00:48:33.807
You're putting your heart and soul
into promoting Kim Seon-u.

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:35.142
Of course.

00:48:35.225 --> 00:48:36.727
A great example
of being a supportive partner.

00:48:37.394 --> 00:48:38.353
How nice.

00:48:40.647 --> 00:48:41.481
Yes.

00:48:48.113 --> 00:48:50.657
Da-rim, come here.

00:48:50.741 --> 00:48:52.200
-Okay. Coming.
-Hurry.

00:48:52.284 --> 00:48:53.368
Just a moment.

00:49:02.544 --> 00:49:06.339
We thought you'd be better than us.

00:49:07.007 --> 00:49:09.426
I mean, I learned English at school, but…

00:49:29.529 --> 00:49:30.572
Location?

00:49:32.866 --> 00:49:35.911
Oh, the place where we took the photos.

00:49:36.536 --> 00:49:39.122
Well… Gangwon-do?

00:49:39.206 --> 00:49:41.082
-Gangwon-do.
-Right.

00:49:43.043 --> 00:49:46.046
Sokcho is… Delicious food.

00:49:46.129 --> 00:49:48.381
-Korean traditional delicious food.
-My goodness.

00:49:48.465 --> 00:49:50.967
Look at those ignorant stay-at-home moms.

00:49:51.051 --> 00:49:52.469
Should I just get rid of them?

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:54.095
Why would you?

00:49:54.805 --> 00:49:55.806
They're doing so well.

00:49:55.889 --> 00:49:57.766
The more ignorant they are, the better.

00:49:58.308 --> 00:49:59.684
The chairman could hear about it.

00:50:02.562 --> 00:50:04.397
What are we going to do about this?

00:50:21.623 --> 00:50:22.999
How is he even good at English?

00:50:28.922 --> 00:50:30.257
I just want to clarify

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:33.552
that my going around with Ha-yeong today
is strictly all for business.

00:50:34.636 --> 00:50:35.887
Why would you tell me that?

00:50:35.971 --> 00:50:37.639
So you don't get the wrong idea
like last time.

00:50:39.099 --> 00:50:41.059
It's awkward for me too, okay?
I'm just trying to get through it.

00:50:41.142 --> 00:50:42.185
Jeez.

00:50:43.019 --> 00:50:44.980
-Give it to me.
-No, I can do it.

00:50:45.063 --> 00:50:45.897
I'll do it.

00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:48.525
-Are you okay?
-I'm sorry.

00:50:48.608 --> 00:50:49.901
Please sit. I'll take care of it.

00:50:56.908 --> 00:50:58.702
You didn't seem awkward at all.

00:50:58.785 --> 00:51:00.787
Even your outfits are matching,

00:51:00.871 --> 00:51:02.330
you were linking arms
all tightly and whatnot,

00:51:02.414 --> 00:51:04.833
and it seemed like
you couldn't take your eyes off of her.

00:51:04.916 --> 00:51:06.501
That's because I'm a good actor.

00:51:06.585 --> 00:51:07.794
I don't think that's what it is.

00:51:07.878 --> 00:51:10.088
It just looked like you two
were very close and being very sweet.

00:51:10.171 --> 00:51:11.423
But I mean, sure, I understand.

00:51:11.506 --> 00:51:13.091
Of course. You're acting.

00:51:13.174 --> 00:51:14.301
Ji-hyeok.

00:51:18.305 --> 00:51:20.348
You should go take care of your business.

00:51:20.432 --> 00:51:21.808
I'm also busy with my business.

00:51:21.892 --> 00:51:23.268
Yeah, I'm coming.

00:51:28.857 --> 00:51:30.400
Hello, everyone.

00:51:30.483 --> 00:51:32.569
I'm Kim Seon-u, the photographer
of the photography exhibition,

00:51:32.652 --> 00:51:33.737
A Green Future We Draw Together.

00:51:41.286 --> 00:51:42.871
Stop it!

00:51:47.459 --> 00:51:51.963
First, I'd like to thank you all
for making time to come today.

00:51:52.047 --> 00:51:54.758
-Now, let me walk you through
-Stop it!

00:51:54.841 --> 00:51:56.301
-each piece in the exhibition.
-Stop it!

00:51:56.384 --> 00:51:58.178
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

00:51:58.261 --> 00:52:00.388
-Behind me, you'll see--
-Stop it!

00:52:00.472 --> 00:52:02.557
I told you to stop it!

00:52:02.641 --> 00:52:04.976
-Seo-yeon.
-Stop it!

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:06.144
You stop!

00:52:06.227 --> 00:52:08.063
Stop it!

00:52:10.482 --> 00:52:12.108
Stop it!

00:52:12.192 --> 00:52:14.027
-Pardon me for a moment.
-You stop.

00:52:15.028 --> 00:52:18.281
It seems the kids got bored.

00:52:18.949 --> 00:52:20.158
I'm sorry.

00:52:20.241 --> 00:52:23.244
They don't want to play the game either,
so we'll just leave.

00:52:23.328 --> 00:52:25.080
If you don't mind,

00:52:25.163 --> 00:52:28.959
we can look after them
while you go on the docent tour.

00:52:29.042 --> 00:52:29.960
Are you sure?

00:52:30.043 --> 00:52:31.086
-Of course.
-Sure.

00:52:31.836 --> 00:52:33.922
-Let's go play outside.
-Come on.

00:52:34.005 --> 00:52:36.424
-It's all right.
-Follow us.

00:52:36.508 --> 00:52:39.344
-Let's have some fun outside.
-Thank you for your understanding.

00:52:41.471 --> 00:52:44.724
All right, I'll start walking you
through the pieces in the exhibition.

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.813
Hello!

00:52:49.896 --> 00:52:51.982
We're the dinosaur family.

00:52:52.065 --> 00:52:54.317
Do you want to guess what I am?

00:52:55.443 --> 00:52:56.569
Do you know what I am?

00:52:56.653 --> 00:52:57.821
-Brachiosaurus.
-Brachiosaurus.

00:52:57.904 --> 00:53:00.865
You're so smart. Then what about this one?

00:53:00.949 --> 00:53:03.076
-Tyrannosaurus.
-Correct!

00:53:04.411 --> 00:53:05.662
Thank you so much.

00:53:05.745 --> 00:53:07.497
I got to enjoy the exhibition
thanks to you.

00:53:08.248 --> 00:53:10.208
I went back to work three months
after my kids were born,

00:53:10.291 --> 00:53:11.835
so I can barely play with them.

00:53:13.294 --> 00:53:14.254
You're so amazing.

00:53:14.337 --> 00:53:15.880
Not at all.

00:53:15.964 --> 00:53:17.090
After raising three kids,

00:53:17.173 --> 00:53:19.342
it just comes naturally
without even trying.

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:21.594
-Thank you.
-Mommy!

00:53:21.678 --> 00:53:23.471
-Yeah, Seo-yeon?
-Oh no.

00:53:23.555 --> 00:53:25.390
Seo-yeon, you should've been careful.

00:53:25.473 --> 00:53:27.767
-I'm sorry.
-Oh gosh.

00:53:27.851 --> 00:53:30.228
No worries, it's okay.

00:53:30.311 --> 00:53:31.438
Don't worry about it.

00:53:32.522 --> 00:53:33.356
Stuff happens.

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:36.067
-Let me pay for dry--
-No, that won't be necessary.

00:53:37.736 --> 00:53:38.611
Are you sure?

00:53:39.446 --> 00:53:40.613
I'll go wash this off.

00:53:40.697 --> 00:53:41.740
Okay.

00:53:41.823 --> 00:53:43.533
Bye. High five!

00:53:44.117 --> 00:53:45.076
Yeah!

00:53:46.077 --> 00:53:47.287
We've only been causing trouble.

00:53:49.247 --> 00:53:51.541
He's a very kind man.

00:54:17.567 --> 00:54:18.610
You came.

00:54:21.613 --> 00:54:22.697
Let's get out of here.

00:54:23.573 --> 00:54:24.824
Already?

00:54:24.908 --> 00:54:25.825
You just got here.

00:54:26.409 --> 00:54:27.577
What's there to see here?

00:54:28.328 --> 00:54:29.621
I'll show you something more entertaining.

00:55:03.613 --> 00:55:04.447
DEPUTY DIRECTOR YU HA-YEONG

00:55:10.411 --> 00:55:11.246
Who are you?

00:55:42.443 --> 00:55:43.611
Who the hell are you?

00:56:40.668 --> 00:56:43.254
What about this one? It's a turtle.

00:56:50.803 --> 00:56:51.638
What's that sound?

00:57:04.692 --> 00:57:05.693
Everyone!

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.821
We need to evacuate everyone quickly.

00:57:08.905 --> 00:57:10.365
Hurry!

00:57:12.575 --> 00:57:14.160
Let's get out of here.

00:57:17.956 --> 00:57:18.831
Hurry!

00:57:53.032 --> 00:57:54.450
Stop!

00:58:01.249 --> 00:58:02.333
Everyone,

00:58:02.417 --> 00:58:06.087
if we move in an orderly fashion,
we can all get out of here safely.

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:09.549
Stand behind the person in front of you
and calmly make your way to the exit.

00:58:09.632 --> 00:58:11.426
Please follow these flashing lights.

00:58:11.509 --> 00:58:14.095
-Please come this way!
-Remain calm!

00:58:14.178 --> 00:58:15.972
-Remain calm!
-Remain calm!

00:58:16.055 --> 00:58:17.932
-Please follow the lights!
-Remain calm!

00:58:18.016 --> 00:58:18.933
-Don't run!
-Remain calm!

00:58:19.017 --> 00:58:20.852
-Don't run! Remain calm!
-Remain calm!

00:58:20.935 --> 00:58:22.061
-Don't run!
-Keep moving!

00:58:22.145 --> 00:58:24.272
-Slowly!
-Keep moving!

00:58:24.355 --> 00:58:25.857
-Remain calm!
-Remain calm!

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:27.817
-Remain calm!
-Remain calm!

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.360
-Don't run!
-Remain calm!

00:58:29.444 --> 00:58:31.863
-Don't run!
-Remain calm!

00:58:31.946 --> 00:58:33.031
-Remain calm!
-Remain calm!

00:58:33.823 --> 00:58:36.367
Can we get the names
of the people in this group?

00:58:36.451 --> 00:58:37.869
-Okay, thank you.
-Can I get your name?

00:58:37.952 --> 00:58:40.580
-It's Lee Min-cheol.
-Mr. Lee Min-cheol. Confirmed.

00:58:40.663 --> 00:58:42.332
Ma'am, what's your child's name?

00:58:42.415 --> 00:58:44.000
-Here's some water.
-Ha-eun?

00:58:44.083 --> 00:58:46.336
Yes, Ha-eun. What about your name, ma'am?

00:58:46.919 --> 00:58:47.962
Is there anyone missing?

00:58:48.046 --> 00:58:50.340
-I think my group made it out.
-Mine too.

00:58:50.423 --> 00:58:52.258
-Mine too. I think that's everyone.
-Okay.

00:58:52.342 --> 00:58:53.217
-Thank goodness.
-Wait…

00:58:53.801 --> 00:58:55.762
What about Mr. Gong?

00:58:55.845 --> 00:58:57.930
-Mr. Gong?
-I haven't seen him for a while.

00:58:58.014 --> 00:59:00.099
-I didn't see him.
-Didn't he come out with us?

00:59:00.683 --> 00:59:01.976
I'll go wash this off.

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:04.562
Wait, it's been a while
since I've seen him.

00:59:04.646 --> 00:59:06.689
-Wait, Da-rim!
-Ms. Go!

00:59:06.773 --> 00:59:07.607
-Where are you going?
-Stop!

00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:09.359
-Ms. Go!
-Da-rim!

00:59:09.442 --> 00:59:10.401
It's too dangerous!

00:59:10.485 --> 00:59:12.111
Stop! Oh no, what do we do?

00:59:14.906 --> 00:59:15.907
Mr. Gong!

00:59:17.784 --> 00:59:18.618
Mr…

00:59:20.453 --> 00:59:21.579
Mr. Gong!

00:59:27.502 --> 00:59:28.544
Mr. Gong!

00:59:29.295 --> 00:59:31.297
Mr. Gong!

00:59:36.761 --> 00:59:37.762
Mr. Gong!

00:59:37.845 --> 00:59:39.722
You need to wake up!

00:59:39.806 --> 00:59:41.224
Oh no!

00:59:41.724 --> 00:59:42.642
Mr. Gong!

00:59:55.363 --> 00:59:56.322
Mr. Gong.

00:59:56.406 --> 00:59:58.449
You need to wake up, Mr. Gong.

00:59:58.533 --> 01:00:00.118
Oh no.

01:00:01.828 --> 01:00:03.287
Mr. Gong.

01:00:31.941 --> 01:00:33.151
Mr. Gong.

01:00:33.234 --> 01:00:34.861
Mr. Gong, are you okay?

01:00:34.944 --> 01:00:36.362
Wake up!

01:00:37.697 --> 01:00:39.741
Oh no…

01:00:39.824 --> 01:00:41.033
Mr. Gong!

01:00:41.117 --> 01:00:41.951
Mr. Gong…

01:00:42.744 --> 01:00:43.619
Mr. Gong?

01:00:45.329 --> 01:00:46.372
Try sitting up.

01:00:47.582 --> 01:00:49.041
Are you okay?

01:00:51.002 --> 01:00:51.919
Oh no.

01:00:53.463 --> 01:00:54.672
Can you hear me?

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.799
Thank goodness.

01:00:57.467 --> 01:00:59.177
Do you know how scared I was

01:00:59.802 --> 01:01:01.304
that something might've happened to you?

01:01:31.751 --> 01:01:32.627
I need to…

01:01:34.462 --> 01:01:35.755
tell you something.

01:01:40.009 --> 01:01:41.511
There are no particular reasons

01:01:42.762 --> 01:01:44.096
as to why I like you.

01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:48.518
I just like you for who you are.

01:01:51.562 --> 01:01:53.064
You're Go Da-rim.

01:01:58.945 --> 01:02:00.196
That's why I like you.

01:02:04.242 --> 01:02:05.201
I love you.

01:02:29.058 --> 01:02:33.980
DYNAMITE KISS

01:03:04.093 --> 01:03:05.511
I think office romances are great.

01:03:05.595 --> 01:03:07.471
We need to be careful at work.

01:03:07.555 --> 01:03:09.348
Do you know how anxious I am?

01:03:09.432 --> 01:03:10.683
But what can I do?
I like you so much, it's killing me.

01:03:10.766 --> 01:03:14.103
How about sending the Mother TF Team
to support the CS team?

01:03:14.186 --> 01:03:16.564
I'm going to get rid of the whole team.

01:03:16.647 --> 01:03:18.316
Please don't do this.

01:03:18.399 --> 01:03:19.609
There's been a misunderstanding.

01:03:19.692 --> 01:03:20.693
What misunderstanding?

01:03:20.776 --> 01:03:22.403
Are you that crazy bitch?

01:03:22.486 --> 01:03:23.696
Yeah, that's her voice!

01:03:23.779 --> 01:03:26.198
An affair with the troublemaker
who's tarnishing the company's image.

01:03:26.282 --> 01:03:27.992
That should be enough
to get rid of Gong Ji-hyeok.

01:03:28.075 --> 01:03:30.244
You're okay. You're not alone anymore.

01:03:30.328 --> 01:03:31.954
I'll always be by your side.

01:03:32.038 --> 01:03:33.247
From now on until forever.

01:03:38.836 --> 01:03:43.841
