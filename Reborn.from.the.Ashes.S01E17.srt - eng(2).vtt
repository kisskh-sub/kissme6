[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 17]

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.400
Those who defy

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.440
will die.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.920
I am the Governor of Yunzhou City.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.090
Even if you are the crown prince
of Prince Zhenbei,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.440
there must be a reason to arrest me.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.040
Were you injured?

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.670
It's nothing.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.190
Governor Su, you abused your position,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.440
colluding in corruption,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.190
and hoarding black gunpowder.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.590
Your crimes are unforgivable.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.840
Take him away.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.840
You really have a silver tongue.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.270
You slander me without any proof.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.710
I have proof.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.400
Su Guang,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.440
all these years,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.710
you've been using me
to transport black gunpowder.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.110
Uncle,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.840
what brings you here?

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.880
Qingran,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.630
take these chestnut pastries.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.190
You came all this way

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.840
just to bring me chestnut pastries?

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.550
I'm leaving tonight.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.000
I don't know when I'll return.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.070
I don't know what's wrong with Su Guang;

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.800
he suddenly told me to travel overnight

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.070
to deliver a batch of goods.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.800
Goods?

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.270
Black gunpowder?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.110
I've never seen it before.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.590
Are you transporting black gunpowder
yourself,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.230
trying to frame me?

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.920
Su Guang,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.320
you're so cruel.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.440
Even with death approaching,
you still blame me.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.480
Fine.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.840
Your Highness,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.810
this is the list Su Guang hid
among the goods.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.660
You can verify the handwriting.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.550
Su Guang, you have committed treason
for personal gain.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.550
You actually sold gunpowder
to the enemy state.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.270
You are not worthy
of being the governor.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.490
[The gunpowder is foreign]
The evidence is clear now.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.990
What explanation do you still have?

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.650
Take him away.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.380
Take him away.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.040
Yes.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.670
Go.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.360
Where did the gunpowder come from?

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.230
Speak.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.960
Hurry up and speak.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.480
Spare me!

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.630
I'll tell you.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.550
I'll say everything.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.520
Speak.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.800
I bought all the gunpowder
from the black market.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.330
Was the poison used
to kill the Qilin Army

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.630
also bought from the black market?

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.360
The Prince already told you?

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.000
Where is the account book?

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.440
Wanyan Lie knows the account book
wasn't destroyed.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.480
What account book?

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.660
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.520
My Lord.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.920
You're the one
who killed the Qilin Army.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.110
You're also the one
who caused General Xiao Zhan's death.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.360
Will you confess or not?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.400
Wanyan Jin,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.040
you don't dare kill me.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.440
Do you really think I'm afraid
to kill you?

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.630
My Lord,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.710
we can't kill him.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.150
I don't know.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.630
I know nothing at all.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.230
My Lord.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.800
Is that all then?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.480
The account book is Su Guang's
only safeguard.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.840
That old fox won't reveal it so easily.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.920
Think of another way.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.800
Yes.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.710
What's the status of Su Guang's case?

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.880
Has he confessed to anything?

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.880
He refuses to say a word.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.190
This case is closed today.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.440
You don't need to waste
any more time on him.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.670
I understand, Father.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.150
You can go.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.040
Your Highness.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.110
Su Guang is a key player
in the case of the Qilin Army.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.520
If he is executed
without any confession,

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.000
I won't be able
to expose Wanyan Lie's crimes

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.990
and personally send him
to the execution block,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.800
to avenge the soldiers
of the Qilin Army.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.840
My Lord,

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.960
we finally captured Su Guang,

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.440
but still haven't gotten
any useful information from him.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.150
Are we really going
to execute him so easily?

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.480
Qi...

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.920
Now that Su Guang is imprisoned,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.160
the account book that can prove
my father's innocence remains missing.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.040
Qingran,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.630
rest assured.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.360
I will ask my father to plead for you.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.840
Thank you for your concern.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.070
But,

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.960
you should go comfort Feiyi instead.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.150
Don't get me wrong.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.230
Su Feiyi and I

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.150
are just friends.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.110
What's there to misunderstand?

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.840
Whether you two are close or not
is none of my business.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.190
You come to my courtyard every day.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.630
It seems

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.230
those without official duties
have plenty of free time.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.700
You are overwhelmed with affairs,

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.550
and I was worried Qingran
would grieve alone,

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.730
so I came over to comfort her.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.000
Do you think she even notices you?

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:24.480
Qi,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.710
it's better for you to focus
on recovering.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.490
Don't dwell on things you shouldn't.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.000
Don't even look

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.520
at what doesn't belong to you.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.670
Honey,

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.750
you really do attract romantic troubles.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.190
But,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.520
they're all bad relationships.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.840
It's all because I was born
with natural beauty

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.540
and a face like the moon
among flowers.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.880
You must keep a close watch.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.960
Honey,

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.550
you do not need my protection.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.750
Anyone who messes with you
will regret it.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.750
It's fine you understand.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.150
Su Guang is already imprisoned.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.360
What do you plan to do next?

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.630
So,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.040
I come here

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.840
to ask you to let you see Su Guang.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.190
Can I?

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:31.630
You're begging me?

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:32.320
Hmm.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.110
Then show

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.550
a more sincere attitude.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.670
Please, I'm begging you.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.710
Please, please.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:58.480
Qi,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.360
I have no home now.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.550
Everything from the Su Family
has been confiscated.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.190
I only have you now.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.040
Back then when I told you

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.150
that I was left all alone,
what did you do?

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.800
You disliked that I am often sick

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.680
and brought her back
to marry me in your place,

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.680
throwing yourself
into Wanyan Jin's arms, didn't you?

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.350
At that time, I had my reason.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.350
What reason?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.840
In truth, you were after his status,
weren't you?

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.560
So the one you loved was never me.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.310
All you cared about
was power and status.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.230
Qi,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.150
I truly wanted to marry you.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.720
At the time...

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.960
It was Grandmother who opposed it.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.770
That's why she arranged
for Su Qingran to be the substitute.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.110
This was never my idea.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.560
If you had truly wanted to marry me,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.600
who could have stopped you?

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.510
Su Feiyi,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.150
do you really think I am
being toyed with in your hands,

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.190
completely unaware of everything?

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.070
Help me one more time.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.110
How else could I do?

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.190
For you,

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.290
I gouged out Wen Yueqian's eyes,

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.990
ruined her face
and thrown her off a cliff.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.680
What about you?

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.390
How have you treated me?

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.600
Wanyan Qi, oh Wanyan Qi,

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.560
stop pretending
to be the innocent victim.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.070
Back then, you treated Wen Yueqian
that way,

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.150
because you were fickle and restless.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.150
Now, you treat me like this

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.070
because you can't change who you are.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.880
Now that you have Su Qingran,

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.190
of course, you've forgotten me.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.720
Don't talk nonsense.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.800
Whether it's nonsense or not,

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.560
you know the truth better than anyone.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.190
Wanyan Qi, oh Wanyan Qi,

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.600
I don't hate you.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.680
I pity you.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.110
You've truly fallen for her.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.190
Just wait.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.150
Your reckoning is still to come.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.390
Su Feiyi, you are now the daughter
of a disgraced official.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.690
Let's not discuss whether my father
would agree or not;

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.000
even if you were to marry
into my family,

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.720
with your status,

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:22.760
you're only fit to be a concubine.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.310
A concubine?

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.230
Is she even worthy of marrying
into our family?

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.040
Why waste words on a lost dog?

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.110
Come with me
to enjoy the plum blossoms.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.110
Let's go.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:00.190
You may leave now.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.070
Yes.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.470
Ran,

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.840
please save me.
