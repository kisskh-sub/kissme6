00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:56.240
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.879
Who told you that?

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.439
I heard it from the Imperial Sister-in-law.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.959
She said the Imperial Brother is sending you
to Mou County.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.200
I'm afraid I won't see you for a long time.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.599
Don't worry.

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:24.719
I'll come back safe and sound.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.040
It's getting late.

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.120
Princess, you should return to the palace.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.280
I should go too.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.159
Young Duke, let me go with you.

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:44.239
Shuang'er is right.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.519
She's thoughtful and can look after you
on the road.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.519
Shuang'er is skilled in martial arts.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.359
How do you know that?

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.159
That day, you were in my father's study.

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:57.280
I knew everything.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:59.840
But what you were looking for

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.159
wasn't in the study.

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.159
The road ahead is dangerous.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:08.879
You must be careful.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.960
I'm leaving.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.680
Let's go.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.400
Come.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.199
Shi Feifan.

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.280
I'll wait for your safe return.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.639
Everyone, stay alert.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.159
Soon, Shi Feifan won't make it back.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.000
Yes.

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:46.360
Young Duke.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.680
Young Duke.

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:02.160
I smell blood.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.560
The mantis hunts the cicada,
unaware of the oriole.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.480
Let's go.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.680
Ziyan.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.720
You betrayed Celestial Star Tower.

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:32.079
You're annoying.

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:51.759
Your Highness.

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:53.360
This is a small token of my respect.

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:54.800
It's especially for Your Highness.

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:00.600
I wonder why Your Highness
came here this time.

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:01.879
Is there something important?

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.319
This time, I came

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.160
to take care of someone.

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:09.639
Rest assured, Your Highness.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.040
No matter who it is,

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:13.079
he won't leave Mou County alive.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:15.759
Shi Feifan.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.720
Even if you escape the ambush ahead,

00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:21.720
you can't escape the net here.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.959
Brave one, wait!

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.160
Did you come from Mou County, sir?

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:47.720
I've heard Mou County is beautiful.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.399
I'm planning to visit there.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:50.759
Brother,

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:54.120
you really can't go to Mou County now.

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:56.000
Why is that?

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.680
Those damn officials in Mou County

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.800
prey on the people and run wild.

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:02.639
Now the people there are homeless.

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:03.879
They can't even fill their stomachs.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.279
Their suffering is beyond words.

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:08.079
You mean the damn officials prey on the people
in Mou County?

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:09.600
How do they prey on them?

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.240
Let's go.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:29.720
Let's go.

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:37.039
Buns!

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.200
Fresh buns!

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:41.759
Hot and fresh!

00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:45.639
Take a look, buns here!

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.399
Young Duke, we've arrived.

00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:57.039
Come.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.240
Slow down, Young Duke.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.039
Slow down, Miss Shuang'er.

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:06.519
Little trinkets!

00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:11.200
Little trinkets!

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.159
Young Duke, could we be mistaken?

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.159
Yeah.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.720
Why is Mou County busier than the Capital?

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:31.240
Latest style fans!

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.159
Come and take a look!

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:33.200
How much is this?

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.600
Rouge and powder!

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:36.879
Ladies, come and see!

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.799
Beef!

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.320
Don't look if you won't buy!

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:52.879
Forget it, forget it.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.240
Let's go.

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:56.639
We don't have money to buy.

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:57.960
Let's go.

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:05.120
Let's go.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.879
You're lucky today.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.600
The County Magistrate said

00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:58.519
we must stay alert these days.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.720
Don't let anyone see a flaw.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.879
Yes, yes.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.759
Yes.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.879
Here, eat quickly.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:06.960
Eat up, eat up!

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.360
Come on, come on!

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:10.360
Grab it!

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.679
Hurry, grab it! Come on!

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:13.960
Hurry, grab it!

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.159
Aren't you hungry?

00:11:17.639 --> 00:11:18.279
Young Duke.

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:20.000
Let me go and take out those damn yamen runners.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.120
You think I don't want to?

00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:23.039
If we rush in now,

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:24.519
we'll only alert them.

00:11:24.879 --> 00:11:25.759
We won't find anything.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.440
Once you're full, go back and take my place.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.759
If anything goes wrong,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.200
your miserable life won't be spared.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.600
Boss, does this really help?

00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:38.000
Those big officials from the Capital,

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.279
they all muddle through like this.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.600
You tell me, does it work or not?

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.559
Hurry back.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.720
There's important business at the yamen today.

00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:49.200
Darn it!

00:11:50.039 --> 00:11:50.679
Spare me, Young Master!

00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:52.320
Watch where you're going next time.

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:54.320
You blocked my way.

00:11:56.159 --> 00:11:57.720
My boots are dirty now.

00:11:58.639 --> 00:11:59.039
Let's go.

00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:08.399
Stop looking.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.360
Someone's following us.

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:21.200
Here's the plan.

00:12:22.039 --> 00:12:24.240
You and the Egg Yolk brothers go scout
the city first.

00:12:24.799 --> 00:12:26.720
Meet at the yamen gate at noon tomorrow.

00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:27.080
Okay.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:27.759
Okay.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:28.840
Let's go.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:29.840
Let's go.

00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:32.600
Young Duke, what about us?

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.120
Thirty-Six Stratagems.

00:12:36.159 --> 00:12:37.519
Feint to the East, Attack to the West.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.279
Feint to the East, Attack to the West.

00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:53.480
We've been tricked.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.639
Your Highness,

00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:58.519
your "catching a turtle in a jar" move

00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:00.039
is truly brilliant.

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:02.440
Even if that kid has the Gatling,

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:03.960
he still can't escape.

00:13:04.919 --> 00:13:06.240
On my turf,

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:08.879
he can't do as he pleases.

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:10.600
Your Highness, you're absolutely right.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.600
Your Highness, Shi Feifan has escaped!

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:16.960
What?

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.279
Then hurry and chase after him!

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:20.480
Where should I chase him?

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.480
He didn't come to the county office,

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.960
which means he's suspicious.

00:13:28.519 --> 00:13:29.440
At this moment,

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.360
he must be looking for a loophole.

00:13:34.799 --> 00:13:35.320
Your Highness,

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:36.879
I know of a loophole.

00:13:37.919 --> 00:13:38.720
Wujia Village.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.639
Young Duke,

00:13:55.879 --> 00:13:56.720
there's a girl there.

00:13:59.559 --> 00:14:01.559
Miss, how do we get to Wujia Village?

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.159
Do you know which way Wujia Village is?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.080
Young Duke, is this girl mute?

00:14:17.159 --> 00:14:17.759
Don't talk nonsense.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.240
Can you tell me now

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.120
which way to go?

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:39.279
Can you take us there?

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.200
Where is your village chief?
