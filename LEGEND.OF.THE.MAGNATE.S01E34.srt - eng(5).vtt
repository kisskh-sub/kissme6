[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.960
[Episode 34]

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.000
The people of Nantong

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.789
no longer have to flee,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.280
and the salt industry of Lianghuai
no longer

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.610
has to worry about being crushed anymore.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.700
All of this is thanks to Your Excellency.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.440
I'd like to raise a toast in your honor.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.350
As expected from Li Million.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.070
Every time he opens his mouth,
it's all business talk.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.880
Well, he's a businessman after all.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.290
What else would he be talking about?

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.970
By the way, everyone,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.840
there's still one guest
who hasn't arrived yet.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.590
Let's wait until everyone is seated

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.720
before we discuss matters at leisure.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.210
Who else is coming?

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.010
What's the rush?

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.910
Even I, the Viceroy of Liangjiang,
am waiting patiently.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.440
Look how impatient you are.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.400
Your Excellency,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.760
your honored guest has arrived.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.890
Quick, bring her in.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.700
Come on.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.910
Honored guest.

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:36.650
Greetings, Old Madam.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.030
Your Excellency, my respects.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.710
This is unnecessary.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.079
I cannot accept this.

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.910
-Mother.
-Please, get up.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.840
Master, are you alright?

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.960
Mr. Gu is the Pacification Commissioner

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.750
appointed by the imperial court,

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.150
and we're also preparing

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.430
to restore his scholar status right now.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.430
Mr. Gu has rendered great service
this time.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.400
Old Madam Gu,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.520
you will surely be granted a noble title.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.520
You don't have to salute officials.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.040
Please.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.000
Please be seated.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.560
Thank you, Your Excellency.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.690
I was staying at home just fine,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.790
yet they came out of nowhere

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.400
and just dragged me here
without even asking.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.820
Come on, sit here.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.370
Old Madam.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.240
Today

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.430
is the auspicious day of the completion

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.120
of the Nantong coastal embankment.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.320
Please join us for a celebratory drink.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.170
My legs aren't in good condition,

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.690
so I haven't been to
the coastal embankment.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.960
But my kid

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.590
has been working nearby

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.150
for months and hasn't gone home once,

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.790
which shows his dedication to work.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.640
Still, this isn't his credit.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.340
I just saw

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.450
those young men
working on the river project,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.810
sweating and bleeding.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.470
Those are the ones who truly
deserve the credit.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.490
I hope that Your Excellency

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.320
can reward them properly.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.350
Old Madam, your words

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.290
truly show a heart of compassion.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.240
I've learned a lot.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.560
You don't have to finish this cup of wine.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.750
Just a sip will do.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.000
That's enough, Mother.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.730
Please be seated.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.279
Everyone.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.270
Old Madam here—

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.990
first her husband went missing,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.620
and she raised her son

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.440
all on her own.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.680
Later, her son was framed by villains
during the imperial exam

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.440
and exiled to Ningguta.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.370
For Mr. Gu

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.010
to achieve what he has today

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.300
is entirely thanks to her.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.830
Now, don't you think it's proper

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.159
for me to have invited
such an honored guest?

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.159
It's only proper.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.900
Li Million.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.050
This is my honored guest.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.750
How can you not toast her?

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.770
Come on. Hurry up.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.390
Go offer her a toast. Come on.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.990
All right.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.920
Here, just hold the cup.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.450
Alright.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.890
I, Li Million, pay my respects
to you, Madam.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.480
Who?

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.950
What's your name?

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.940
Mother,

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.630
he's Li Million,
the wealthiest man in the capital...

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.360
Shut up!

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.159
May I ask

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.950
your name, Sir?

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.840
I am Li Million.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.420
My respects to you, Madam.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.650
Mother!

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.730
Father.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.370
Mother,

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.670
what's wrong?

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.270
I haven't

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.700
had a drink in decades.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.180
I actually got myself drunk today.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.790
What have you got

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.220
up your sleeve?

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.180
You have no idea—

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.210
I've got something

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.159
specially to deal with Li Baiwan.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.050
Old Madam.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.580
Please get some rest.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.160
Wait.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.600
Why?

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.450
Didn't we just unload these?

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.510
Why are we putting them back up?

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:17.120
Young Master,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.380
it was Master's order.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.500
M...

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.440
Master's order?

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.340
Your mother

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.720
is having acupuncture right now.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.380
Don't go in.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.800
How is my mother doing?

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.130
I was meaning to ask you.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.480
Why haven't you told us

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.630
what happened to your mother?

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.640
I have no idea.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.100
I wanted to ask you.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.920
Ever since your mother came back,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.080
who knows why,

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.840
but she's been unconscious
and won't wake up.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:48.940
Doctor.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:50.810
Doctor, please.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.600
All right.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.120
Don't go in and disturb her.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.680
Let's speak softly out here.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.070
Alright.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.800
Speak softly.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.330
Alright.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.240
Doctor,

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.210
how is my mother doing?

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.550
This illness

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.520
is very strange.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.920
Judging from her pulse,

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.280
her spirit is damaged

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.800
and all 5 meridians are injured.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.710
Only a sudden surge of

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.070
extreme joy or sorrow

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.030
could cause such a condition.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.110
That's odd.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.370
I'll write a prescription

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:36.610
to protect her heart meridian first.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:38.669
Doctor,

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.440
so it can only be protected

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.240
but not cured?

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:44.870
This is an illness of the heart,

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.130
so only a remedy for the heart
can cure it.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.670
Mr. Gu,

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.170
I still need you to tell me

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.030
what exactly

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.440
happened.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.750
What on earth happened?

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.000
Right, what happened?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.750
Tell us the details.

Why are you stopping... Stopping me?

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:12.710
Young Master.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.600
Come with me.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.000
Don't pull me.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.170
Wait.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.080
What happened exactly?

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.250
Wasn't everything fine just now?

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.030
We'd take Jiangsu

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.140
and leave the rest to Gu Pingyuan, right?

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:21.840
Why is he

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.550
suddenly giving them the cold shoulder?

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.670
How would I know?

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.690
So you don't know?

couldn't endure that.

You're all so accommodating to him now.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.580
He has guests all day long.

Who are these people anyway?

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.390
They're former salt merchants
from Yangzhou,

I've gone in to make tea for them twice,

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.390
and all they do is brag.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.940
Your brother has been up all night.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.000
Don't disturb him.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.570
What are you doing?

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.290
Was I, Gu Pingwen,

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.730
just born to work?

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:29.610
Pingwen.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.040
Behave yourself.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:34.570
Mr. Gu.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.380
My family has been in the salt business
for generations.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.380
I'm incompetent.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.090
During the chaos of war,

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.230
all of Jiangnan

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.570
became a slaughterhouse,

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:42.720
and I had no choice but to

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.550
sell our ancestral salt fields hastily.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.160
But I do know about

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.890
salt transportation and trading...

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:48.970
I understand.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.000
You've come to request a job,

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.440
right?

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.390
That's right.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.460
First, to request a job;

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.520
and second,

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.390
to borrow some cash from you, Mr. Gu,

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.380
for emergencies.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.720
How much do you want to borrow?

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.720
I may not have that much cash

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.380
to lend you.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.900
200 taels would be enough.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.610
I'm running short on chicken feed lately
as well.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:05.250
And

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.060
the young man who went
beyond the pass to buy ginseng

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:07.670
hasn't returned yet.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.690
I can only buy some in town

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.750
and make do with it.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:11.770
Isn't that Mr. Pan?

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.120
Don't leave yet.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.320
I happen to have something
to talk to you about.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.380
Why are you avoiding me?

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.240
Did I offend you or what?

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:18.970
Come on, sit.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.390
Mr. Pan here

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.640
is quite a character.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.360
One night, he came to borrow money
from me.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.960
He came right at dinner time,

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.960
so I asked him to join me for dinner,

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.820
but he refused.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.820
He said

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.720
he had just finished eating

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.790
the five-spice beef cooked by

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.120
the best chef in Suzhou.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:38.920
His stomach was,

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.450
you know,

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.320
completely stuffed,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.530
and he could only have a few drinks.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.080
So I said, let's have some drinks
together then.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.510
But after just two cups,

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:45.460
Mr. Pan threw up.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.130
There was chaff all over the floor.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.170
S-Stop messing around.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:49.910
Stop it.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.200
I get it now.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.270
Maybe it was because

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.240
"I ate beef,

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.990
and the cow had eaten chaff."

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.960
Your words were a bit too harsh.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.870
How hurtful.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.840
I just didn't want you to be fooled.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.510
Mr. Pan is addicted to opium.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.010
From head to toe,

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.360
those clothes he was wearing

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.510
are his most valuable possession.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.120
He's sold his wife and children,

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.050
and he's been starving every day,

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:20.850
running around to borrow money.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.680
Don't lend money to people like him.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.540
Alright. Thanks for the warning.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.150
How is your mother doing?

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.150
She still hasn't woken up yet.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.280
I'm really worried.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.030
How are things on your side?

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.120
We hired the best doctor in the capital,

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.380
and he said phlegm had clouded his mind.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.880
I just can't believe it.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.600
My father has been sharp his whole life.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.800
How could his mind be clouded by phlegm?

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.870
Tell me,

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.150
what exactly was that about?

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.410
You want me to tell you?

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.090
I was meaning to ask you the same thing.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.790
My dear Pingyuan.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:51.850
It seems to me

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:52.920
that your mother

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.270
is doing slightly better

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.130
than my father.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.140
How about you help me

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:57.860
ask her what that was about

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.920
after she wakes up?

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.030
Given my mother's current condition,

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.120
I wouldn't dare ask her
even if she wakes up.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.270
Why don't you go home
and try asking your father?

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.510
I wouldn't dare ask him.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.040
I don't want to die just yet.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.670
However,

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.670
the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office
has been pressing us.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.510
If we keep hiding at home like this,

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.040
they'll send soldiers
to arrest us tomorrow.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.280
I understand.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.670
Wait for me to grab something to eat.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.000
I'm going to the Viceroy's Office

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.750
for work.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.000
I'll have to leave everything here to you.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.600
I'm here.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.520
Don't worry.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.640
I can't refuse

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.220
this lousy job.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:05.620
Had I known,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.910
why would we have ever left our hometown?

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.170
That's not your fault.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.550
They forced us out

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.270
with guns.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.270
Anyway, I have no time for you now.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.550
I have to take care of Mother.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.150
Take good care of yourself and Heizi
on the way.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.750
You should also ask Pingwen and Miss Liao

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.510
to come help you from time to time.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.910
Don't exhaust yourself.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.170
Don't say such things.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.720
Pingwen is too clumsy,

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.480
and Miss Liao hasn't married into
our family yet.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.410
It won't hurt if I work a bit harder.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.640
What have I done to deserve you?

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.880
It's enough to have you.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.780
I said, having you in this life

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:55.690
is enough.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.830
What was that?

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.390
Mother,

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.760
I'm going on official business.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.550
I'm off.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.030
[Liangjiang Viceroy's Office]

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.630
-Greetings, Your Excellency.
-Greetings, Your Excellency.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.030
No need for formalities.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.790
You two have finally arrived.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.250
The Liangjiang Viceroy's Office
is honored by your presence.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.330
Your Excellency.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.550
The elders in our families
fell gravely ill.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:38.750
As children, we're truly heartbroken.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.900
Please forgive us, Your Excellency.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.260
Without you two here,

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.080
Jiangning City has been in mixed spirits
as well.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.810
Gu Pingyuan,

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.610
I still need to reward you.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.480
I wouldn't dare to accept that,
Your Excellency.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.270
You're too kind.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.350
The old businesses along Qinhuai River
have all been restored.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:58.430
As expected,

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.730
it is teeming with visitors,

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.600
and merchants come and go
in great numbers.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.630
The Complete Library of
the Four Treasuries

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.720
republished by
the Jinling Publishing House

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.240
is selling throughout the country.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.510
Scholars are as numerous as
fish crossing the river.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.200
I believe that within a year,

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.080
the city will be fully restored
to its former glory.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.250
This achievement

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.750
must be credited to you.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.240
You've demonstrated the unity
of civil and military strategy,

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.170
a balance of restraint and action.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.750
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.270
Those were all

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.270
methods not fit for public display.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.600
As the ancients said,

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.840
"governing a great nation
is like cooking a small fish."

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.870
How can that be called

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.930
something unfit for public display?

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.510
Appetite and desire are both natural.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.040
Starting from these basics

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.580
is actually the Great Way.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:38.430
Exactly.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.510
When the two of us

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.030
were entering Jiangning today,

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.810
we already noticed it was
much more prosperous

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.030
than when we left for Nantong.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.510
This is all thanks to
your strategic wisdom, Your Excellency.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.040
Alright,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.290
enough flattery.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.930
The Lianghuai Salt Field Guild

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.440
has had the notice posted
for nearly half a month,

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.930
yet you two were nowhere to be found.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.270
The former salt merchants of Lianghuai

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.360
have been staying in inns,

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.910
spending every day thinking up ways

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.320
to bang drums and file lawsuits

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.630
at the Viceroy's Office.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.430
Frankly, it's driving me crazy.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.890
Let's get things straight.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.240
I'm giving you 10 days

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.740
to work out a solution.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.000
With government supervision
and merchant management,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.069
I'm now in control of

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:12.349
the supervision part.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.880
If you can't get it done within 10 days,

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.550
both of you, put on cangues

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.880
and stand at my doorway.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:18.680
Alright.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.589
You should get going.

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.270
I wouldn't dare waste

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.640
the precious time of you great merchants.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.140
Let's go.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:36.830
Look.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.300
That old fox Rui Lin is so cunning.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.070
He's made the two of us

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:41.130
like a pair of oxen—

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.830
he won't spend a single penny,

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.070
yet he's got ropes through our noses,

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.130
pulling us around.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.920
This just isn't right.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.930
I'm worried too.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.090
How should we deal with
those old salt merchants

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.620
from the Salt Fields Guild?

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.470
I can't let them see me.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:55.900
With all due respect,

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.120
my father

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.200
seized their salt fields

00:17:59.200 --> 00:17:59.730
by force.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:00.720
Luckily, they don't know

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.250
my father is bedridden now.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.530
Otherwise, they'd be swarming in

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:04.790
to tear me apart alive.

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.070
Our Li family

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.030
now selects capable assistants

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.300
from our shops each year

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.160
and sends them out to become managers

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:10.890
on their own.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:12.240
My father

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.200
has gathered quite a few talented people

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.320
for the salt field business.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.650
If you're short‑handed, just let me know.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.740
Thanks, buddy.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:18.400
Buddy?

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.280
Our agreement still stands.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.160
If you can't outperform me
within 6 months,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.930
you'll have to hand over
the salt fields you're holding,

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.400
so my father won't mock me
for being incompetent.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.660
I'm well aware of that.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.450
But what if I do outperform you?

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.000
Don't worry about that.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Just do your best.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:34.220
I certainly won't

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.020
go easy on you.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.920
But one more thing:

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.580
we'll always be buddies.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.120
I feel the same.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.000
What?

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:56.550
I only asked you to follow me.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.310
Why are you sticking that close to me?

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:59.510
You think I want to?

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:01.680
I just helped you repair
the coastal embankment,

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.610
and now I have to act as your escort.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.270
If Yu'er hadn't threatened me,

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.790
what bastard would be willing to

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.050
stay that close to you?

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:09.900
Come on, tell me,

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:11.710
what did Yu'er say to you?

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:13.160
She said,

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.510
if anyone comes in your way,
I'll shield you;

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.670
if there's a knife coming at you,
I'll take the blow;

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.060
if you cause any trouble,

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.240
she'll pay with her life;

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.590
if even a strand of your hair
falls from your head,

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.010
I'll have to give my life for it.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:23.880
Listen, if you dare lose
even one strand of hair,

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.810
I'll stick it right back in for you!

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:27.400
Well, well.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.180
I've brought back a hothead.

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:32.320
Listen, Heizi.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.840
If there's nothing else,

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.010
you should go back to Nantong.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.400
What do you mean?

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.290
Are you looking down on me?

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.650
We're all scholars.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.030
Don't keep

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:48.980
pulling out your knife to scare me.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:50.230
Fine, fine.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.510
If you don't want to go back, then don't.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.000
If you don't cause me trouble,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.930
I won't cause you trouble, either.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.130
Let's make sure this trip goes
smoothly and safely.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:00.270
I'll take you back safely

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.240
without a scratch,

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.500
and my job will be done.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:03.760
I believe you.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.990
After all, you, Heizi,

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:07.650
are a man of your word.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.550
Stop buttering me up.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.750
As if I didn't know

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.070
I'm a man of my word.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.350
Good man.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.080
I need a favor right now.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:18.580

Let me tell you something.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.920
Listen, everyone.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.410
Gu Pingyuan and Li Qin,

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.720
those two little bastards

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.010
are trying to drive us

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.330
Lianghuai salt merchants to our deaths.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.270
We need to find some

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.510
court officials from Lianghuai,

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.420
buy off a few of those lords,

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.310
have them submit memorials

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.000
to bring them down.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.930
Bring them down.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.000
What's the use of that?

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.550
Right now in the Liangjiang region,

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:48.790
Rui Lin has everything
under his thumb.

[Tu Ying, Lianghuai Salt Merchant]

But we can't just do nothing!

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.720
Our family business has been passed down
for two or three centuries—

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.750
how could it be wiped out

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.010
over just a few scraps?

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:02.170
This is just...

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.410
I just can't wrap my head around

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.680
how it ended up being

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.590
the property of
the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office!

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:08.920
Where's the title deed?

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.290
If you have the title deed,

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.000
I'll go with you

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.720
to file a lawsuit
at the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.230
When under a low roof,

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.590
one must bow their head.

where you're from

Mr. Tu,

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.740
there's no need for such a grand salute.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.640
What are you talking about?

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.420
You call this a salute?

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:21.410
You, Gu,

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.680
you really have no respect

You see, at the Salt Industry Guild,

there are too many people and gossip.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.830
I wanted to ask for your advice,

but it wasn't convenient there.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:47.020
That's why I specifically asked him
to invite you here.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.750
Is this how you invite someone?

Look at the back of my neck!

Let me tell you something.

I've invited you here today.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.350
I'm sure you already know why

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.550
even if I don't say it.

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.410
Let's get straight to the point.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.550
The salt industry of Lianghuai

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:34.610
is the biggest business in Jiangnan.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:35.920
What can't common people

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.830

Salt.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.030
What can't armies do without in war?

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.350
Salt.

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:44.250
Even the war horses,

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.870
if you don't add salt to their feed
at night,

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.110
when they charge during the day,

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.240
they won't run fast.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.190
So gaining control of salt

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:54.030
means securing control of
our country's lifeline,

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.030

Mr. Tu, if you don't speak today,

is that, Mr. Tu,

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.270
you need to tell me the truth.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.170
I'm not like my father.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:30.380

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.110
First,

the money for repairing the salt fields

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.170
is ready.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:35.590
When you arrive there,

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.480
repair the salt field as fast as possible,

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.590
hire assistants, secure lodgings,

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.120
and open up shops for me.

Throughout the Jiangsu and Jiangxi
regions,

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:42.840
within 3 months,

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.810
I want shops everywhere.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:46.400
Second,

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.380
I'll give you another 3 months

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.720
to expand into

I don't mind you spending my money.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.960
What I do mind is that
you lack the ability

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.810
to put that money to good use.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:04.120
Is that clear?

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.510
Yes, Young Master!

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.310
Actually, the salt fields

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:11.810
were not destroyed.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.240
When the Resistance Army was here,

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.570
we kept doing business.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:18.400
Since we couldn't do business
with the imperial court,

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.310
we did business with the Resistance Army.

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.790
Besides, they paid us

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.570
every copper coin in full.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:24.720
The problem was that

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.680
the imperial court found out about this.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.800
The imperial court said

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.290
we were aiding the rebels.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.890
No one could bear such an accusation.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.330
So some people,

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.340
before Jiangning fell,

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.030
whether deliberately

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.290
or not,

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.640
sold their salt fields.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:42.590
They were protecting themselves from

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:44.830
future trouble with the imperial court.

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:45.590
Li Wantang

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.410
took advantage of that

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.790
and acquired many salt fields.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:51.150
But of course,

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.440
there were also some worthless people

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.880
like that Pan fellow,

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.810
who lost his fortune to opium

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:58.040
and secretly

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.750
sold his salt fields

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.440
to Li Wantang.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.870
Things like that also happened.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.080
When we left,

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.980
we pushed the mud walls

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:11.350
into the salt fields,

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.240
telling everyone

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:14.570
that we abandoned them.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.600
You can't tell from the outside.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.070
I see.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.970
These are all

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.820
just business tricks we use.

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:25.440
It's not surprising

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.640
that you didn't know.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:27.830
The shops

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:30.200
and assistants are all still there.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.400
It's just that the title deeds are gone.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.240
I understand now.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.720
Mr. Tu.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.550
These days,

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.270
I've been reviewing the ledgers.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:41.480
I have some ideas now

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.590
and need your advice.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:49.910
At your command.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:51.810
[Goods In-and-Out Ledger]

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.160
Too harsh.

[Salt Industry Guild]

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.800
I know what you all are thinking.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.310
You see that I'm young

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.440
and an outsider,

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.640
so you're worried I'll profit
from your industry, right?

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.290
Or perhaps you think

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:50.030
I'll be like Li Wantang,

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.970
using the imperial court's power

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.540
to seize your family businesses.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.780
Am I right?

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.750
Since you all have doubts,

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.680
feel free to speak up.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.420
If I can solve your problems,

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.580
I'll do that;

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.210
if I can't solve them,

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.350
at worst,

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.520
I'll give up my half of the salt fields

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:09.310
to you all.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:12.530
I keep my word.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.590
I'm just temporarily
overseeing this duty anyway.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:17.790
Stepping aside for someone more capable

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:19.250
is not out of the question.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:21.830
Please, ask away.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.400
Mr. Gu, have you ever made salt?

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:24.830
No.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:26.790
Mr. Gu, have you ever run a salt shop?

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:28.030
No, I haven't, either.

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.590
Mr. Gu, do you plan to transport by water

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.310
or by land?

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.920
I haven't thought about that yet.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.240
Mr. Gu, back in the Canal Gang,

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.030
what was your rank?

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:35.550
Rank?

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:37.130
No rank?

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:38.410
Then you must've been an outsider.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:39.440
What do you mean outsider?

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.640
Did you have a master?

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:42.790
What master?

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.480
Come in and speak.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.100
Well, Master is still ill.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.330
I'll tell you later.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:57.550
Even if you say it now,

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:59.510
my father probably
won't be able to hear it.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.970
And even if he does hear it,

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:02.830
I'm the young heir now.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.840
Just speak when I tell you to.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:06.920
Yes.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.280
It's about the salt field again.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:12.550
About that guy Gu Pingyuan...

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:13.680
Call him Mr. Gu.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.690
You're not on his level yet.

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:17.590
Young Master.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.680
The more someone competes with us,

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:22.410
the more respect we should show them.

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:24.030
Gu Pingyuan,

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:26.040
even as a prisoner,

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.330
has managed to stand toe-to-toe with us.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.960
Isn't that worthy of your respect?

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.790
Yes.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.200
Mr. Gu

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:37.270
has gathered all the former managers

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:38.130
and assistants

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:40.450
of the Lianghuai salt fields.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.470
He dares to hire those people?

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:45.480
They're all

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:46.960
wily old foxes.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.810
Can he really handle them?

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.390
Look at you all,

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.710
with such tiny, petty ambitions.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:56.750
I've told you

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.170
that Mr. Gu has no experience.

00:33:58.170 --> 00:33:59.900
So what if he has no experience?

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.470
Salt transportation

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.110
is generally divided into two types:

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.590
land transport

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.270
and canal transport,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.440
and canal transport requires
the Canal Gang.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.020
All our former head managers

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:16.949
joined the gang.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:18.159
This means

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.090
you need to find someone

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.360
older than you

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:21.510
to be your master.

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:23.310
This way, wherever you go,

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.000
you won't be bullied.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.630
Even if you're not in the gang,

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:30.420
you still have to claim you are.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:32.350
In the trade, this kind of person

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.150
is called an "outsider."

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:36.960
The rule of canal transport is:

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.290
pretending is allowed,

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.420
but denying is not.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.630
There's no crime in pretending,

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.270
but if you do pretend,

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.920
you can't deny it.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.170
Now along the Grand Canal,

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:49.070
among hundreds of thousands of
Canal Gang members,

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.670
most of them are "outsiders."

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.070
I've learned something.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:55.199
So is this Canal Gang

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.300
very powerful?

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:58.120
Of course.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.840
Even Emperor Qianlong was once
a member of the gang.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.190
We still preserve

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.220
the dragon-headed walking stick

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.880
made of purple sandalwood
that Emperor Qianlong bestowed upon us.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.000
It's passed down

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.590
as a token among successive gang Chiefs.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:11.710
However, Mr. Gu,

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.730
with your status

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.990
and position,

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.360
it won't be hard to join the gang, right?

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.070
Sure, sure. Not hard at all.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:21.430
Thank you all for your guidance.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:23.730
I'm a tea merchant.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:26.070
You could say I know absolutely nothing

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:27.470
about the salt industry.

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.880
Heizi.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.460
Bring out the gifts

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.240
we prepared.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.330
He even brought gifts for us.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:36.480
This Gu Pingyuan is quite thoughtful.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.080
This is my own homegrown tea,

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.650
called Orchid Snow tea.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:41.820
The Empress Dowager

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:42.400
has bestowed upon it the title

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.070
of "Top Tea Under Heaven."

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.710
Top Tea Under Heaven?

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.230
As this is our first meeting,

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:48.400
please accept this small gift.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.370
Everyone, please take it home
and give it a try.

[Orchid Snow]

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.190
Mr. Gu.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.500
We all know you have good intentions,

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:57.280
but good intentions

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.230
are useless in business.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:01.360
The apprentices in salt shops

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.510
need at least 3 years to
complete their training.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:04.410
Indeed.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.460
With just a few words from us,

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.190
there's no way to turn you into

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:06.880
an expert.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.230
Mr. Gu.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.670
You're too young—

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.400
you're no match for Li Million.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.440
Everyone.

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:14.840
I may never become

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.370
an expert in this lifetime.

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:19.330
But it doesn't matter.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.890
What matters is that

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.550
all of you here are experts.

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:27.070
His Excellency personally told me

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:29.030
that he wants the salt industry profits
made in Lianghuai

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:30.480
to stay in Lianghuai.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:33.680
Therefore,

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:34.900
this battle between Li Wantang and me

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.230
isn't one I'm fighting—

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.270
it's you who're fighting it.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.300
And you must win this battle for me,

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.040
and for yourselves!

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:44.870
Starting today, I'm setting a new rule:

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.000
for all salt shops,

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.030
we'll split the net profit 30-70.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:50.300
-30-70?
-30-70?

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:51.400
I'll take 30%,

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.630
and you'll take 70%.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:54.400
How's that?

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:56.040
Mr. Gu,

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:58.600
are you joking with us?

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.210
The boss takes 30%

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.700
and the staff take 70%?

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:03.940
Isn't that completely upside down?

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:04.710
When I do business,

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:05.930
I never joke.

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:06.800
As long as

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.150
I'm still in this position,

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:09.920
this rule will never change.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.230
-Great!
-Excellent!

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.960
Mr. Gu,

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.710
we'll fight this battle with you

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:14.700
and win it!

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.840
For Mr. Gu,

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.230
we'll win this battle!

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:19.630
Let me say this one last time.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.260
It's not about me winning.

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:23.280
It's about you winning!

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:30.500
[600 copper coins per bundle]

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:30.570
Mr. Gu said to lower it
by another 100 copper coins.

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:32.400
[Gu's Salt Shop]

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:32.800
Got it.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.400
[500 copper coins per bundle]

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.400
500 copper coins.

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:38.710
Today we're changing the price to...

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.310
300 copper coins per bundle.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.370
Go and notify all shops

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:43.480
to change it immediately
and not wait until dark.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:43.960
Yes.

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:45.730
Stop there!

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:50.030
Young Master.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.060
We can't do business this way.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.000
If you keep competing like this,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.200
when will it ever end?

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.310
The salt brought out from the salt fields
already costs 300 copper coins,

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:57.760
with food for people
and feed for horses on the way,

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.000
plus all these labor and material costs—

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.800
nobody does business like this!

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.800
So how do you think

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:12.400
we should do business?

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:16.030
Anyway, if Master were conscious,

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:17.760
he would never approve of this.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:19.230
Aren't you just

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.960
shooting yourself in the foot?

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.000
Running the shops for one day

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.030
with all these resources

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.550
will cost

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:24.840
nearly 100,000 taels of silver.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.230
Is 100,000 taels a lot?

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.110
Of course it's a lot!

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.250
You haven't even

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.250
earned that much from the shops yet.

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:44.960
Fine.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.790
Fine then.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.820
Young Master,

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.820
you really can't compete like this.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.720
Young Master,

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.730
please don't be childish.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.760
He's an amateur—

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.400
do you want to be one too?

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:04.630
I am an amateur indeed.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:06.960
But...

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.200
When the Master wakes up,

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.420
how am I supposed to explain this to him?

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:13.890
Haven't I told you

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.710
that before my father wakes up,

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:15.550
I'm the boss?

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:18.030
I don't need you to teach me
how to do business.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.670
Besides,

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:20.440
if I didn't know how, I would ask you.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.370
If you make a scene in public again,

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.070
I'll send you packing

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:24.890
back to the capital.

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:25.960
Do you understand?

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:29.880
Also, is 100,000 taels of silver a lot?

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:30.230
Sure it is.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.550
So who do you think can afford that,

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:32.580
us or Gu Pingyuan?

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.800
My approach is

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:34.750
to settle this with him

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:35.610
within 10 days.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.070
Six months is too long.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.400
I don't have that much time
to waste on him.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.250
[My name is Chang Yu'er.
Husband Gu Pingyuan.]

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.300
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming back?

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.160
I thought I'd come back to check
if Mother's awake yet.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.230
There's no point in checking.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:32.110
Come on, let's go.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:32.480
Let's go.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.940
What are you writing here?

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:35.140
Nothing. It's nothing.

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.140
What's this "Husband Gu Pingyuan"?

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:38.680
I-It's nothing.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:39.480
Let me see.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.190
Go quickly. Weren't you going to check...

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:43.520
How about I check on you?

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:47.820
Check on me then.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:00.300
I'll go make you something to eat.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:00.960
Move aside.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.930
It's tea harvesting season again,

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:24.760
yet we can't go back.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.010
If Mother's health were better,

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.560
I'd really want to take Mother
back to Huizhou.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.640
Didn't you find someone to help?

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.220
What's the use of that?

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:40.050
Mr. Liao isn't going back either.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.150
This year, we won't even
be able to harvest

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:44.950
a single tael of Orchid Snow tea.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.480
Brew some tea from home

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.010
for Mother to taste as well.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.560
Don't let her drink medicine all the time.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:12.920
Go eat.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.940
Father is waiting for you.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.870
Mr. Chang must've been worried.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:24.000
If we're talking about transporting salt

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:24.960
by land,

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:26.480
that's a simple matter.

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:29.440
I've been running the horse gang
my whole life.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.900
The amount of salt you have

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.000
would only take one horse caravan

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.070
making 3 to 5 trips

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:34.320
to transport it all.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:36.800
I think

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.900
the most urgent matter now

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:41.030
is that the salt price isn't rising.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.030
If you keep pushing yourself like this,

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:44.630
when will it ever end?

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:47.190
I want to transport salt

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.810
from Sichuan.

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:48.470
Si... Si...

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:50.000
Sichuan?

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:52.570
Although Sichuan's well salt

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:53.630
is cheap indeed,

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.550
what you're engaged in now

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:56.960
is a price war.

00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:59.600
Don't tell me

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.280
you're thinking of
trafficking illegal salt.
