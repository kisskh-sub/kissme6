00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:06.510
so you have to come back with me.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.480
Jiu.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.360
Chairman, nothing.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.480
As the old saying goes, one can't bring a disaster to the family.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.990
He should take responsibility.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.360
This has nothing

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.120
to do with you,

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.390
but I despise people

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.870
who don't care about their families

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.670
when things go wrong.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.390
Madam, I'm so sad for you.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:56.960
Meng Qin.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.790
Since you're shameless,

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.360
I'll do as you wish.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.840
Strip her naked

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:07.630
and leave her at the door

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.360
for all his neighbors to see.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.910
The backbone of the Meng family,

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.480
the hero.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.960
Put her clothes on

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:19.030
when Meng Qin appears.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:19.960
Let go of me.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.030
Don't bully my mother.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.720
Help me. Let go of him.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.560
Hang her up.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:38.960
See?

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.910
Wouldn't it have been fine if you'd shown up earlier?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.630
Why do you make me do things I don't want to do?

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:44.630
Honey.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.200
Just give them whatever they want.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.600
I haven't begged you in all these years.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:52.870
Just give it to him.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.960
Madam is right.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.320
Why is he in such a hurry?

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:02.560
Exactly.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.510
Hello, My Lord.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.670
My Lord.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.240
Did you call us here

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.960
to discuss something important?

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.000
I'm traveling

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.880
to Xichuan in a few days.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.340
When I leave Jibei,

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.840
I'll have peace of mind

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.390
if you can handle the affairs

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.670
of the royal household.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.750
My Lord, don't worry.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.720
We will do our best.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.120
Liu Luan may not be on our side anymore,

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.870
but I have taken control of him with Japonicus.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.120
When I go to Xichuan,

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.030
I will take him with me

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.300
to prevent him from interfering in the government.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.390
After I leave, Sage Can,

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.360
please take care of the treasury and taxes.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:51.960
Yes, sir.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.200
Sage Mao.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.910
You recommended Du Shang,

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.200
and he helped me a lot.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:58.790
I'll leave the military affairs

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:03.630
to you and Sage Kui.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.080
Yes, sir.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:20.840
I'll drink tea

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.840
to the three of you.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.150
It's our job.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.030
You're welcome, My Lord.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.790
We await your triumph.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.360
I've hidden the Painting of Luan

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.320
in a hut in the mountains outside the city.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.670
Enter the mountains from the north entrance,

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.030
cross three hills,

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.320
go west for a mile,

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.560
and go north when you

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:09.720
meet the fork in the road.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.270
Then you will see the hut.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.440
Just in case you're lying to me,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:14.960
please

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.270
take us there.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.440
It seems we are late after all.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:58.510
Fu Sheng.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.030
Look at this.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.710
[Xichuan]

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.150
It's a different color inside.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.080
It should have just been carved.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.000
I think this should be the clue

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.080
Meng Qin left us.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.140
What kind of clue is it?

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:25.390
It's a map.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.950
I didn't realize you

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.440
had such a large courtyard here,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.270
but I don't know

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.030
if there's an ambush here.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.440
Cut the crap. Let go of me.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.240
I'll take you in.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:48.200
It's inside.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.270
Are there

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.360
any traps in here?

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:55.790
No.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:58.670
If you

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.390
hadn't been willing to bring me here,

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:02.750
I might have been more at ease,

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.630
but you've been walking so smoothly

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.710
and in such a hurry all this way,

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.150
so your mind is so obvious that even a fool can see it.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.600
Are you afraid?

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.080
How about this?

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:16.560
You, go in and get

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.520
the Painting of Luan with him.

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:19.520
I will wait for you

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.230
outside with your wife and children.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.800
When you give me the Painting of Luan,

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:26.710
I'll return your wife and child to you.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.000
Go.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.510
Now that you're married to him,

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.520
accept what happens.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:44.360
It's your destiny.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.290
Surely, there is a trap.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.360
Meng Qin.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.040
Don't you care about the lives of your wife and child?

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.360
I will kill them.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.320
Kill them.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.840
Please spare my life.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Got the painting?

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.080
Chairman Guo.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.630
This guy is so cunning.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.670
I almost had it.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.280
Which means you didn't get it?

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.320
Thank you for saving my life.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.600
I don't have it now,

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.710
but I have a countermeasure.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.710
Meng Qin.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.630
He's still breathing.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:16.280
Help him up.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.670
Meng Qin.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.390
Is that Sun Siming?

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:40.040
Save my wife and son.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.390
It's too late.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.630
Tell me.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.020
Where's the map you said you'd use

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.360
to decipher the mechanism?

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.520
I am sorry.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.200
I lied to you

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.760
to save my wife and son.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.280
There's...

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.340
There's no map.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:06.640
What did I say?

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:09.600
It's all a lie, but you don't believe me.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.670
Painting...

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.360
Painting of Luan.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.190
The bucket at the bottom of the well.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.120
I didn't...

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.870
I didn't tell them where it really is.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.280
You. Run.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.490
He'll kill you

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.300
after he

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.760
gets the painting.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.430
Put him down.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.520
Is this the Painting of Luan?

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.150
[Painting of Luan's hiding place]
No, it's not.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.190
This is the real hiding place of the Painting of Luan.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.520
It seems a dying man

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.360
speaks the truth.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.040
This time, he's not fooling us.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.710
He just said we should run

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.840
because he was afraid Sun Siming would kill me

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.430
for the Bird Jade Plate.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.430
Let's go.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.040
You'd better not go.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.280
I think Sun Siming

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.150
is ambushing us nearby.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.840
Then I have to go.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.800
Nerds like you can't fight.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.150
With your Ghost Needle,

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.430
you might turn into a ghost.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.080
Don't worry.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.800
I've had nothing but luck

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.120
in my life.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.000
Take the time

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:10.360
to read what it says.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.040
The sun travels west, and the pavilion appears.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.950
The grass is sparse on the hillside.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.040
What does that mean?

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:19.620
The sun travels west.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.150
It's just right now.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.120
The pavilion.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:30.120
There.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.430
What else does it say?

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.520
Green bamboo leaves, the Xuan shines.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.890
The red in the green indicates its location.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.280
"Green bamboo leaves" refers to this bamboo forest.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.920
Xuan

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.640
means Luan.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.040
So the Painting of Luan is here.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.190
How are we supposed to find it in such a big bamboo forest?

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.950
It also says "red in the green".

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.870
Where's the red color

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.120
in all this green?

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.930
Let's split up and look for it.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:11.630
I'll go there.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:12.280
You go there.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.710
Red in the green.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.800
Gu Tian, I found it.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.080
"Red in the green"

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.230
must be this spot.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.910
I'll dig.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:59.110
I don't want

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:01.800
to burden you with this physical labor.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.320
Painting of Luan? Shouldn't this be Ball of Luan?

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.280
You're a disaster for me.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.430
I always said my life

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:24.670
would be lost because of you.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.040
Looks like it's going to come true this time.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.150
I'm sorry.

Fu Sheng.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.720
The Bird Jade Plate has always been

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.680
with you,

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.280
but you never mentioned it.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.560
You didn't think of me as a friend.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.450
The people who were your friends are dead.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.000
I don't agree with you on that.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.200
I've always treated you

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.430
like brothers.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.070
Have I ever refused to help you

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:51.520
when you came to me?

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.280
But when it comes to the Treasure of the Sealed Book,

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.280
you just care about making money

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:57.430
and never mentioned it to me.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.840
I'm disappointed.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:02.760
Cut the crap.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.430
Get down to business.

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.040
See?

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.320
Chairman Guo is very impatient.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:11.760
OK.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:13.430
I won't talk any more.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:14.470
Let's get down to business.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.630
Hand over the Bird Jade Plate

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.280
and the three pieces of jade.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.600
I know

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.430
you've already got your hands on them.

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:22.320
Come on.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.520
I don't have them.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.120
You don't have them?

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.800
Search him.

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:50.430
Where did you put it?

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.000
Somewhere safe

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.670
where you won't find it.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.560
I told you I'd get you out safe and sound.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.080
Still want me to keep the jade plate for you?

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:00.950
Take it.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:03.670
You take it.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:04.710
It's more secure.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.150
That makes sense.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:22.800
Kill them.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:24.910
Kill them?

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.840
These two know too much,

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.280
so we need to prevent future problems.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.080
But we haven't found the Bird Jade Plate.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.230
It must be in that clinic

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:36.840
or

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.760
with that little girl from the Lord's Mansion.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.080
I got you, didn't I?

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:46.800
Do it.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.280
Actually,

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.760
Chairman Guo,

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:50.430
I owe

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.190
Fu Sheng a favor,

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.840
so could you spare their lives

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.840
for my sake?

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:01.710
For your sake?

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.390
Who do you think you are?

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.600
If you can't find the Bird Jade Plate,

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:11.320
you won't live either.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.040
My friends.

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:27.710
You saw it.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.150
That's all I can do for you,

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:31.560
but I promise

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:34.320
I'll visit your tombs on this day next year.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.840
And I'll bring with me one,

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.520
sorry, two jars of good wine.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.120
Rest in peace,

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.840
friends.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.720
Wait a minute.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.810
I have something to say.

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.280
Fu Sheng, before we die,

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:53.800
can you fulfill a wish of mine?

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:55.870
What wish?

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.190
Call me brother.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:01.800
Do you know what's the occasion now?

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:03.630
Can you? Answer me.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:04.600
I...

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:08.470
Brother.

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:12.950
What? I didn't hear you.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:14.520
Brother.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.760
So nosy even at the end of your lives.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.470
We didn't expect you

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.430
to be disturbed by our internal affairs.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.950
Chairman Sun, you thought too much.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.760
We didn't want to interfere with you guys at first,

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:46.040
but as the saying goes,

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.300
little help brings much return.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.800
Fu Sheng is my savior.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.360
If something were to happen to him in Xichuan,

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.040
I, as city lord,

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.840
would be mortified.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:06.390
You're worrying too much.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.080
Fu Sheng is my good friend

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:10.630
and saved my life.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.910
We're joking.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:16.840
That's good.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.390
In that case,

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.670
can I take him away?

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.120
Of course.

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.800
Are you hurt?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.260
No. You're just in time.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.800
Luckily, you told Wen Jue before you came.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.520
Let's go. She's waiting for us at the bottom of the hill.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.320
What will you do about the jade plate?

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.040
Chairman Guo, don't worry.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:01.910
I have a plan,

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:04.120
but before we get the jade plate,

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.000
there's one more thing we need to take care of.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.190
This

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.760
is a list of three thousand spies,

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.630
copied by my men from Feng Qianli.

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.190
This man has been in Xichuan for years

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.320
and has much access to information.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.430
Now that he's heard the Lord's name,

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.020
I'm worried that, before he died,

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.390
he already passed on the news

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:27.800
in ways we don't know about.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.710
Whether he knows it or not,

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.360
Lord's plan

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:34.710
can't be compromised.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.150

Sun Siming, you've killed so many people,

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.160
so how will you explain this to the Lord's Mansion?

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:03.910
I've already arranged a scapegoat.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.870
You're despicable.

so I can definitely save him.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.120
No problem.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.400
No problem.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:58.410
No problem.

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:53.310
Gu Tian.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.740
Please don't die.

00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:59.870
We haven't paid you

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.040
or found the Treasure of the Sealed Book.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.190
We agreed you'd get a share of it, didn't we?

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.550
We haven't gone back to Shangyi together.

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:11.670
Your brothers are waiting for you.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.270
We also said

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.590
we'd be brothers for life,

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.360
and we'd keep on living together.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:20.440
Don't die.

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:22.150
Don't die.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.230
I can do it.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.840
I can save you.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.110
I can save you.
