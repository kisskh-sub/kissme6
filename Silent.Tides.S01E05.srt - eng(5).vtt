00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.020
[Episode 5]

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.620
Zhang, you handle the initial check.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.920
Sort patients by severity—

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.140
critical cases first.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.680
Okay.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.289
Lin.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.250
Zhengping.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.210
Lin.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.250
Since the war started in Hong Kong,

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.770
I haven't heard from you.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.850
I was so worried about you.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.040
I didn't expect to see you here.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.990
Are you okay?

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.460
Lin.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.400
I'm fine.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.510
That's good.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.340
Oh, right.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.110
Could you come with me for a moment?

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.360
I want a word with you.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.520
Let's go.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.120
Lin.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.060
These are my friends.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.329
Some of them are quite famous.

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.660
Did you recognize them?

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.240
They do look familiar.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.620
I saw a few of them
at the charity gala in Macau.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.300
Lin.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.590
Let's talk over there.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.730
Lin.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.210
Since you know

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.890
my friends' identities are special,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.090
I'll cut to the chase.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.680
I'm in a hurry to get them through the checkpoint.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.020
Do you have any ideas?

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.390
Take a good look.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.840
Remember these faces.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.150
I don't have any ideas either.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.560
Right now, the checkpoint
only allows entry, not exit.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.680
Since they sealed the checkpoint,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.210
the Japanese have kept
a constant watch here.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.820
When they made the announcement
about the passes just now,

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.110
their guards suddenly withdrew.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.890
But as I was coming here,

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.930
I noticed a large group of
unidentified people

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.710
gathering in an alley not far from here.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.440
I don't know what they're up to.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.790
What worries me now is

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.740
that there're so many patients
in the checkpoint.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.670
The medical team is understaffed.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.310
I need to find some volunteers to help.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.890
Lin.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.430
You need medical volunteers?

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.230
Yes.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.030
I brought in masks and armbands.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.180
My friends would be perfect for this.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.110
They're all well-educated.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.170
Once they get the basic medical know-how,

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.630
they'll start right away.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.710
What do you think?

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.270
That would be great.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.800
That's exactly what I need.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.290
Please help me

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.110
move the patients.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.410
Here you are.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.190
The rest of you,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.380
according to the groups
I just put together,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.560
assist the doctors.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.920
Hand these out.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.360
Director Ke.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.020
Are these people capable

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.290
of being volunteers?

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.670
Why not?

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.590
A lot of the medicine we brought

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.860
has labels in English.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.730
They're well-educated.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.680
They can understand them.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.670
Ordinary people might not be suitable.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.260
Dr. Ke.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.820
Okay.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.230
Dr. Ke.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.560
Miss Qiao.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.560
Mr. He.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.650
Yu.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.450
She's been shot in the leg.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.320
Inspector General Gonçalves.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.320
Who are those people

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.670
entering the checkpoint?

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.050
You don't need to ask about that.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.050
As for the distribution of passes,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.850
you don't need to worry about it either.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.680
Leave it to these two gentlemen.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.670
Every pass must be approved by them

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.530
to avoid mistakes and omissions.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.180
Inspector General Gonçalves.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.550
They brought some people in.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.530
What's going on?

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:19.990
Mr. Lok Pak.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.290
To open the gate as soon as possible

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.730
and avoid a worse humanitarian crisis,

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.930
we have no choice but to comply
with the Japanese demands.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.930
They were arranged by the Japanese?

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.170
Everyone, listen up!

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.050
We're about to issue

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.500
special passes.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.180
When your name

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.380
and identity are called,

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.710
come here to collect it.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.320
Do you remember me?

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.050
I'm a client of Huilong Bank.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.090
He's a traitor!

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.360
Are you blind?

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.240
Miss Qiao.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.980
There are many familiar faces here today.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.920
Familiar faces?

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.000
The man who just shouted

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.800
was a client of mine in Hong Kong.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.290
Later, I heard

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.310
that he had ties with the Japanese.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.720
I don't know if it's true.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.730
Is that so?

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.150
Other people

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.680
mustn't disturb the peace.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.810
I am

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.930
a representative of the Chinese merchants

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.530
and the Chairman
of the Macau General Chamber of Commerce.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.790
Those whose names are called,

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.250
please come forward
to collect your passes.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.170
He Xiangning.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.150
Liu Yazi.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.060
Cai Tingkai.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.350
Chen Jitang.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.240
Mei Lanfang.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.090
Qian Jiaju.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.580
Gao Shiqi.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.760
Zou Taofen.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.710
Cai Chusheng.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.760
I'm sorry.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.560
I accidentally knocked over
the medicine bottle.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.330
Doctor,

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.050
I'm so sorry.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.850
It's alright.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.860
I'll just get another bottle.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.790
Here's a new one.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.670
Is it enough?

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:32.650
Take this medicine

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:33.680
3 times a day.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.940
Two tablets each time.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:35.380
Okay.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.050
Thank you, Doctor.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.510
Mm-hmm.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.320
Yu, let's go back.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.860
Go.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:42.020
Excuse us.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.230
-Let us through, please.
-Excuse us.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.230
Make way, please.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.450
Is there anyone whose name

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.730
was just called?

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.720
Is there anyone at the level
of Director or above

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.360
from the Hong Kong
General Chamber of Commerce?

00:07:59.360 --> 00:07:59.750
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.400
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.060
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.180
What?

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.230
Huang Gongjie?

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.730
Yes.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.410
I saw him at the checkpoint.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.550
The ones who brought those foreigners in
and issued passes

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.110
were Huang Gongjie and Wang Qiuzai.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.090
I'm going to kill him.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:14.620
Zixia.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.110
Didn't you see the checkpoint

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.880
is guarded by many Portuguese soldiers?

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.560
If you rush in to kill him,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.170
you'll get yourself killed too.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.850
That bastard is right in front of us.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.680
I can't swallow this insult, Uncle.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.610
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:28.990
You'll have a chance

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.000
to make him pay.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.730
I am a consul
of the British Empire in Macau.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.549
Are there any British people here?

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:40.130
Please come and get your passes.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:47.770
-If you want to live, keep quiet.
-I am a consul
of the British Empire in Macau.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.030
Are there any British people here?

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.150
Please come and get your passes.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.610
-I'm here.
-Here.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.220
Over here.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.150
I'm British.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.340
Please come forward
to collect your exit permit.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.050
There's no problem.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:09.830
Robert Johnson.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.680
Charles Adams.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.650
Move back.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.220
Keep going.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.540
What are you doing?

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.200
Slow down. Move back.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.030
Move back.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.770
Miss Qiao Yinwan.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.770
Miss Qiao Yinwan, are you here?

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.580
Qiao Yinwan.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.130
Miss Qiao.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.030
Are you here?

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.290
He seems to be calling your name.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.200
He's calling me?

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.600
Is the violinist

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.670
Miss Qiao Yinwan here?

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.910
I'm here.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.310
Chairman Gao.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.680
Miss Qiao, you finally came.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.390
This is the last exit permit.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:58.410
Please take it.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.320
The people you called earlier are

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.320
either celebrities of great renown

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.720
or top representatives
from all walks of life.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.320
Why was this last exit permit

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.750
issued to me?

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.150
This last exit permit

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.720
was

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.510
reserved for you

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.910
as Mr. Lok Pak instructed.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.270
He values you highly.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:20.730
Please take it.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.680
Colonel Sawa.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.390
Since the passes don't work,

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.910
then maybe the fugitive you mentioned

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.870
isn't among these refugees at all.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.010
I can't say for sure.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.930
But your uncertainty

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.700
could cost thousands of lives,
couldn't it?

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.370
Since yesterday,

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.080
dozens of refugee corpses

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.150
have accumulated in the warehouse
of the Port Authority.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.050
If they're kept inside for another night,

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.080
the number of bodies downstairs

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.600
will certainly multiply.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.770
Isn't Portugal

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.440
a Catholic country?

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:58.680
Your Excellency,

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.770
why don't you all pray to your God

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.060
for good weather

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.560
tonight?

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.320
[Macao Special Pass]

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.390
Miss Qiao,

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.890
this is the last exit permit.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.370
You don't take it.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.500
Do you want to stay here and wait to die?

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.560
There are so many wounded
and sick people here.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.700
The elderly, the weak,
women, and children.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.500
They all need help more than I do.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.680
How can I possibly take this pass?

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:38.910
And who

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.960
has the right

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.980
to shut us refugees

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.290
out of this checkpoint,

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.570
leaving us to rot?

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.370
And you issued these passes

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:46.600
with such fake compassion.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.330
You're absolutely shameless!

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.290
Whoa!

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:50.960
You bitch,

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.910
you're pushing your luck, aren't you?

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.290
Are you sure you don't want this pass?

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.100
How about this?

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.700
Release the old people,

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.440
the children, and the patients first.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.720
You want to catch fugitives.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.530
These people are not your targets.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:08.510
Mr. Rodrigues.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.510
I heard you voted

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.630
against opening the gate, didn't you?

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.460
I did vote against opening the gate,

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.430
but that doesn't mean I'll stand by

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.830
and watch innocent people trapped inside.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.290
It wasn't until I arrived here

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.350
that I saw the horrific scene inside.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:23.730
Agency Chief Sawa.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.380
A gentleman

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.390
is supposed to have some conscience,
isn't he?

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:31.800
Sorry.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.300
I'm a soldier.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.680
There is no room for negotiation.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.580
Everyone, listen up!

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.310
I have the last pass under my feet.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.720
Whoever picks it up

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.540
can leave immediately.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.450
Did you hear me?

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.100
The last one.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.030
Whoever gets it leaves.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.960
If no one picks it up, it'll be voided.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.960
I'm counting to ten.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:03.480
One.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.910
Two.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:07.970
Father.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.410
Three.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:13.130
Little Miss, come.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.750
Four.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.580
Five.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:20.480
Daddy,

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.900
where are you going?

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.080
-Six.
-I have something to do.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.130
I'll be back soon.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.410
Wait for me.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.130
Seven.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:31.820
Eight.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.290
Nine.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:35.930
Wait!

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.770
Xian,

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.870
why are you in the checkpoint too?

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.080
If I had known you were here,

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.230
I would have sent this pass to you.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.960
If I pick it up now, can I still leave?

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:51.800
Of course.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.610
Please.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:53.940
Mr. He,

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.760
what are you doing?

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:56.990
I'm sorry.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.180
I have urgent business. I must leave.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.800
Who is this guy? He's so shameless!

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.660
Didn't you see?

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.170
He's in cahoots with

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:04.630
the pass issuer.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.280
I was wondering who could be so shameless.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.730
It's him again.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.650
Don't you all know who this man is?

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:10.670
He's the well-known owner

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.130
of Huilong Bank in Hong Kong.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:16.130
He's someone profiteering
from the national crisis.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.310
Don't you dare speak out of turn.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:29.930
Brother Xian.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.290
They're just sour grapes.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.180
Please feel free to cross the checkpoint.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:34.770
I'll escort you.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:35.530
No need.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.940
I'll go by myself.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:37.400
He Xian.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.530
-Exactly.
-He Xian.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.200
Exactly.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.070
So shameless.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.090
-It's him.
-It's him.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:53.890
Xian.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.480
Mr. Lin.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.150
Mr. Lin.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.010
Here are all the exchanged U.S. dollars,

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:01.070
not a cent missing.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.680
I don't know what to say.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.510
I heard Huilong Bank
was bombed by the Japanese

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.060
and suffered devastating losses.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:11.990
But you still...

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.080
I took on the task,

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.540
and I had to see it through.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.300
It's my duty.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:17.790
I'll save the thanks

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:18.790
for another time.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:19.540
By the way,

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.840
where is Assistant Manager Chen?

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.300
Didn't he return with you?

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.620
Assistant Manager Chen

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.970
tragically lost his life.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:33.720
Mr. Lin,

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.080
I'll take my leave now.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:35.960
Wait, Xian.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.930
You need to meet someone important
with me today.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.150
These are the U.S. dollars

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.480
that Mr. Ma and Mr. Lin entrusted to me
to exchange.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.100
Every dollar is accounted for.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.030
Please check the amount.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.670
I remember

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:50.410
your bank

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.980
was bombed to rubble by the Japanese,
wasn't it?

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:53.600
Yes.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.030
The currency

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.300
was exchanged just before the bombing.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.100
It's truly unbelievable.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:15:59.720
After all this time,

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.630
no one knew about this money.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.340
Mr. Rodrigues.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:05.370
Due to the war,

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.300
I couldn't deliver this money promptly.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.820
If this has caused you,
Mr. Ma, and Mr. Lin

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.990
any inconvenience or loss,

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.820
I apologize to you all.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.880
Please forgive me.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.060
Now that the money has been delivered,

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.600
if there's nothing else,

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.030
I'll take my leave now.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:27.490
Where are you going?

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.380
My family is in the checkpoint.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.930
I have to go back to be with them.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:32.750
Wait.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.820
This is the Governor of Macau,

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.020
Governor De Solaire.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.410
The others are

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.290
all members
of the Macau Executive Council.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.100
Mr. He,

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.450
if you need it,

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.600
we can find a way

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.510
to get your family out safely.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.530
Release my family from the checkpoint?

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:47.980
Yes.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:49.030
What about

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.220
the others in the checkpoint?

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.100
Mr. He.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.340
The Japanese are demanding

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.930
that we close the border immediately

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:56.960
and search for

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.280
all Chinese and British fugitives.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.840
Portugal is a neutral country.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.150
Macau is neutral as well.

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:06.280
As an international free port,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.260
we cannot involve ourselves in your war.

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:12.210
Right.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.760
Portugal is a neutral country.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.200
Macau is a neutral territory.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.720
So you can close the gate

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.650
and leave the refugees to rot,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.569
right?

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.069
Mr. He,

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:26.540
we have our own...

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.390
I know.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.930
It's all about how powerful and fierce
the Japanese are.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.790
You can't afford to provoke them.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:33.850
But does that justify

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.570
leaving countless vulnerable people

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:36.860
to die?

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.170
Ask yourselves.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.440
What difference is there
between your actions now

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.720
and those of the Japanese invaders

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.460
who occupy our land

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.160
and slaughter our people?

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.960
Macau

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.020
has always been Chinese territory.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.020
Don't assume
that because China is weak now,

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.880
we'll forever be trampled on

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.170
and bullied.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.960
There is justice in this world.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.920
I believe that one day,

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.010
justice will be served for
what happened today.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:10.110
Huh?

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.520
Why is he back?

Why is he back again?

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.280
Didn't he leave?

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:16.910
Why is he back again?

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.370
-Who is he?
-Why is he back?

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.610
Why would he come back?

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.500
Daddy.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.130
Mr. He.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.180
It's done?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.760
The fact proved that
the Chinese people is indeed honest.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.920
Therefore, I'm changing my vote

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:51.630
to support the immediate opening
of the gate.

In the past 30 hours,

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.480
the Macau government
was forced to close the Customs.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.090
-Let's go home.
-Let's go home.

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:32.390
This caused all travelers
to be stranded at the pier,

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:33.970
unable to enter Macau.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:35.850

It's complete chaos.

We already found the targets

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.280
and were about to catch them.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.460
But the gate was open.

that Macau is an

the Japanese have no intention
of letting you go.

My Flower-Stern Ferry

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.570
was originally a passenger ship.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.280
If it hadn't fallen into disrepair,

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.090
it would have never been docked here

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:56.690
and turned into a residence.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:58.540
It's not as good as a proper house,

it provides decent shelter.

Besides, it's cheap.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.090
So it's quite popular.

we won't have to sleep here anymore.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.760
Headquarters required you

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.430
to submit an overall strategy for Macau.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.930
It's time for you to give your answers.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.870
My opinion is

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:24.930
to maintain the status quo in Macau.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.180
Elaborate.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.090
Yes.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.480
Judging from this checkpoint incident,

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.350
the Portuguese Macau government is,
as we predicted,

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:36.990
very weak and prone to compromise.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.550
Therefore, I believe

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.720
that with the Imperial Army's might

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.850
as our backing,

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:42.390
we'll face no problem

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:44.720
in coercing the government
into cooperation

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.560
through diplomatic means.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.280
This is currently the strategy for Macau

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:53.390
with the lowest cost
and the highest expected payoff.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.240
Colonel Sawa, what's your opinion?

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.670
Consul Fukue's strategy

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.700
is completely wishful thinking.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.480
Why did you say that?

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:11.960
You said the Portuguese Macau government
is prone to compromise.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.130
But they disobeyed
the Imperial Army's order

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:22.280
and opened the gate without permission,
causing us to miss the fugitives.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.000
How do you explain that?

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.240
But

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.390
the Portuguese Macau government
initially chose to cooperate.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.150
Wasn't it

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.380
your aggressive stance

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.240
that backfired?

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:37.700
Is that so?

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:42.130
Well then, I'd like to ask you, Mr. Fukue,

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.070
for the Portuguese Macau government,

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.910
is dignity more important

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:51.110
than the trade dominance?

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:54.990
The trade dominance is of course
much more important.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:57.670
If that's the case,

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:02.130
the Portuguese Macau government
chose to defy the Imperial Army

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.970
just because their dignity was hurt.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.740
How could we seize Macao's trade control

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.020
simply through diplomatic means

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.630
and expect the Portuguese Macau government
to hand it over willingly?

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.110
Isn't that just a pipe dream?

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:20.830
If we militarily occupied Macau,

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.590
the Empire would lose
this international trading post

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.180
to replace Hongkong's.

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:31.460
I never said I want to
militarily occupy Macau.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.700
Then what do you want to do?

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:38.070
My strategy is also to preserve Macau.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.040
But unlike Mr. Fukue,

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.670
I'll preserve it in name only,

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.760
but occupy in reality.

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:47.440
What are you talking about?

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:52.520
To maintain the Empire's strategic supply,

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.220
Macau must replace Hong Kong.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.110
Therefore,

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:58.280
we must preserve
Portugal's nominal suzerainty,

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.330
so that Macau can maintain its status
as an international free port.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:02.090
This is

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.260
preservation in name only.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.890
However,

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:09.100
if we want Macau
to serve the Empire's interests,

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:11.330
we must ensure that China
and the Allied forces,

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:12.910
gain no benefits.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:13.630
We must bring Macau's

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.540
politics, economy, military, and security

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.200
entirely under our control,

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.700
making the Portuguese Macau government
our complete puppet.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:21.740
This is

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.090
occupation in reality.

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:27.200
This is the best strategy.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.830
It's a pipe dream.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.480

would never agree to this.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.040
