=Episode 20=

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.560
Your Highness.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.990
What if the Grand Secretary
misunderstands you?

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:38.519
No.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.680
He would never doubt me.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.090
How could she act like this?

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:05.319
I am furious.

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.599
The Princess Royal is far too bold.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:08.890
It goes against all moral codes.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.680
The late emperor is barely in his grave,

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.319
yet she keeps company
with that disgrace.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.080
Etiquette is no longer the main concern.

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.599
Gan Sheng's ambition is clear.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.719
He accepts
the title of Prince Wu'an today,

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:20.560
and tomorrow he may covet the throne.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.240
Indeed.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.970
In my opinion,
marriage is only his excuse.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.159
Rebellion is what he truly seeks.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.599
If he joins hands
with the Princess Royal,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.879
the empire of Jing

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.000
may fall in a single night.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.400
I will seek an audience immediately.

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.319
Even if it costs me my life,

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.560
I must stop this from happening.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.319
Official Lin, I will go as well.
And so will I.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.879
Everyone.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.639
Her Highness must have

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:40.719
had no other choice.

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:44.840
If we rush in now,
we will only drive Gan Sheng into fury,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.479
and the consequences
will be beyond control.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.439
Yuanze,

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.520
you are far too trusting.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.960
Xiao Pingning is cruel at heart.
She would stop at nothing.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.879
You and I have seen it clearly.

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.479
How could we trust her so easily?

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:56.840
I know well.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.400
You and the Princess Royal share a past.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.280
Back then,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.120
you even blamed your master for it.

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.439
But matters of state

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:04.879
concern the fate of the realm.

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:07.759
Personal feelings
must never cloud judgment.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.759
Everyone condemns
Her Highness as vicious.

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:16.800
But think carefully.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.000
Since she returned
to assist in governance,

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.879
have any loyal officials

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.919
been wrongly punished under her rule?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.120
Think again.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:29.500
These past few days,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.599
she has moved freely within the palace,

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.680
even pressured His Majesty.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.680
Yet has His Majesty's learning

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.479
not grown rather than diminished?

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:39.159
But she does
bear a grudge against us scholars.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:40.000
She may...

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.520
She may resent officials,
but she has never harmed the people.

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.680
If she wished to spill innocent blood,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.800
five years ago,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.000
she could have driven Beijiang

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.120
to massacre the borders.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.560
Yet she did not.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.639
That may be true,

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.360
but who can guarantee it now?

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.840
I can.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.719
I will bear witness.

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:03.000
This is…

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.639
In this time of peril, I pledge
in the name of the Grand Secretary

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.199
that all of you may trust me

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:10.639
will safeguard

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:12.879
peace in Jing.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.279
I will follow
the Grand Secretary's lead.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.879
- We will follow the Grand Secretary's lead.
- We will follow the Grand Secretary's lead.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.040
Yuanze.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.160
How is it?

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.199
Gan Sheng has stationed heavy guards
around the Princess' Residence.

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.319
No message can get through.

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:12.439
Song.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.600
(Empress Dowager)
Give this letter to the Empress Dowager.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.590
Ask Her Majesty to take Her Highness out
under the pretext of worshiping Buddha.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.639
Meet at Lotus Pavilion.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.260
(Lotus Pavilion)

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:59.040
Are you hurt, Your Highness?

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.040
I thought

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.600
you were here to question me

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:16.439
for breaking my word.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.279
I understand your hardships.

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:20.639
How could I blame you?

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.600
Besides,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.439
have you forgotten?

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.800
We are allies now.

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.480
This token was given to me
by Your Highness' own hand.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.399
There is no taking it back.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.600
You...

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.399
You went through great trouble

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.439
to see me.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.160
Surely not for small talk.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.959
How could your safety
ever be small talk?

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:55.879
But I do

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:59.199
have news to report.

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:03.400
I must ask Your Highness

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.279
to cancel the marriage with Gan Sheng.

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:09.639
Why?

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.400
My teacher's manuscript
has been mostly deciphered.

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:15.480
In a few more days,

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.720
everything will be clear.

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:17.879
It records

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.759
every crime Gan Sheng has committed.

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:21.300
He has embezzled funds,

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.520
colluded with foreign forces,
and stole military merit.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.720
Once it is revealed,

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:27.480
his influence in the army will crumble.

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:30.240
And then, we will finally
be able to remove him.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.920
It is a sound plan.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:36.680
But it will take time.

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:38.759
If that is the case,

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:41.439
I should marry Gan Sheng instead

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.040
and buy us some time.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.360
Your Highness...

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.360
You know it too.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.959
It is indeed the best option.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.040
Right?

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.519
I cannot bear

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:07.519
to watch you risk yourself again.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.000
You make it sound

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.519
as if I am marching to my death.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.160
Your Highness...

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:18.279
Do not worry.

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:20.759
I am not as noble as you imagine.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.639
Besides,

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:25.160
I still have you.

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:30.360
I trust myself,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.559
and I trust you.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:57.919
I

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:01.279
will not fail you, Your Highness.

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:04.600
Grand Secretary,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.759
what is our next move?

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:09.799
The board is set.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.759
But one final piece

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:14.039
has yet to fall in place.

00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:14.960
Hyah.

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:16.200
Hyah.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.700
(Prince Wu'an's Residence)

00:09:23.879 --> 00:09:25.711
(Qian Yong, Deputy General under Gan Sheng)
I, General Fuyao, Qian Yong,

00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:26.679
(Qian Yong, Deputy General under Gan Sheng)
request an audience with Prince Wu'an.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.100
(Record of General Fuyao)

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.240
Yuanze.

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:37.039
Who exactly is this Qian Yong?

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:38.320
Why does he concern you so?

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:41.799
Gan Sheng has many capable officers.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.080
But only this one

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.679
is truly trusted by him.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:46.720
Look here.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.200
The victory at Moquan Pass,
the Battle of Blackwater River,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.840
the ambush at Broken Blade Ravine, these

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.039
are all his achievements.

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:57.399
He is a fierce warrior indeed.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.879
Qian Yong was born to a humble family.

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:00.159
He cares for the army.

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:02.840
He is honest and never seeks credit.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.200
So he holds great respect in the army.

00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:08.159
Then why has his name

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:09.720
never reached the court?

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.120
Gan Sheng keeps him suppressed,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.799
not allowing him to stand out.

00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:15.320
He fears being overshadowed.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.399
And Qian Yong endures it?

00:10:17.799 --> 00:10:19.639
His loyalty to Gan Sheng is unwavering.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.440
Do you know why?

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:27.240
He has a daughter.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.480
Her name is Qian Yu.

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:38.799
I, Qian Yong,

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:39.879
greet Prince Wu'an.

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:41.720
Prince Wu'an?

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.559
Empty titles mean nothing.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.480
Call me General.

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:47.200
General.

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:50.679
General.

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:52.960
Yu brewed this herself.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.039
Before I left,

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.360
she reminded me again and again

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.879
to give it to you in person.

00:10:57.159 --> 00:10:58.300
All this time in the capital,

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.639
I thought only of this drink.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.600
Please thank her for me.

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:06.840
I cannot.

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:08.639
You saved my whole family.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.720
Without you,

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:11.919
Yu's life would have been ruined.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.879
I...

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:16.559
I can never repay you.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.080
Enough.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.840
We are brothers.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.320
No need for formalities.

00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:25.120
With you here,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.679
the war in Nanjiang

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:28.879
troubles me far less.

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:31.360
General.

00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:33.600
I am here.

00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:37.000
No enemy shall cross

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.960
into Jing.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.000
General.

00:11:43.159 --> 00:11:43.960
Let's drink.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.980
