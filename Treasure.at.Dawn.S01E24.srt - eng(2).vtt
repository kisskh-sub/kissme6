I dealt with very few things,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.630
and I'm tired.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.140
I'm old.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.310
Father, you're kidding.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.670
Father, you're in good health.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.920
You're blessed.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.400
You're not old.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.030
Don't flatter me.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.820
I know

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.200
my body.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.390
Father, you're right.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.430
You're right.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.520
I heard some news.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.920
I'm worried about you.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.130
What are you worried about?

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.520
I heard

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.880
you're going

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.630
to Xichuan

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.560
to look for the Treasure of the Sealed Book.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.360
Xichuan is far away.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.070
You'll stay there

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.800
from dozens of days

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.800
to years.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.920
It's a long ride.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.830
Cut the nonsense.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.000
What are you trying to say?

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.640
Yes.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.240
Father.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.240
I'm trying to say

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.640
that our Jibei Mansion

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.240
has the best food,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.910

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.750
And we have

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.310
loads of silver and gold.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.310
Why do you want to go that far

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.720
to look for the Sealed Book?

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.640
I'm wrong.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.270
I'm wrong.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.000
Don't talk nonsense.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.310
I don't need the treasure.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.640
You know what I want.

Chairman Sun.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.110
You found the evidence so quickly.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.390
But you didn't tell me.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.080
You don't have any other ideas, do you?

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.870
Chairman Guo.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.270
You misunderstood me.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.390
I have

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.240
to make sure

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.870
before I can tell you.

I see.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.670
I thought you didn't want me to know

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.080
that you were Song Jingye's horse slave.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.960
It's my bad.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.520
It's all a result of their training.

That person is Meng Qin.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.050
He didn't trust us,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.670
so he didn't want to tell us the truth.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.990
What should we do?

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.200
Let's find a way.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.160

You are the Young Mistress of Xichuan.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.670
Nonsense.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.790
Can you think normally?

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.110
I mean,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.930
he's an older father.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.670
He must spoil his son.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.310
What about the kids?

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.600
Generally speaking, naughty children are healthier.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.280
Spoiled children are not so healthy.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.790
So, Fu Sheng has a chance.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.200
You're not married.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.310
How do you know so much?

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.230
Because I was spoiled as a child.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.760
What do you think, Fu Sheng?

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:20.460
You have a point.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.310
Do we have to go?

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.400
You can't stay in Xichuan anymore.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.430
I'll get you out of here.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:07.760
You go out of the city first.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.480
I'll meet you outside the city.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.290
I will wait for you outside the city with our son.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.880
Just go.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.610
Go.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.880
Meng Qin.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.070
You have the wrong person.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.360
I said you had the wrong person.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.430
Save it for Madam.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.280
Mr. Meng, are you all right?

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.280
Take him back to the clinic.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:16.040
Okay.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:17.160
Go.

Put it there.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.890
It promotes blood circulation and removes blood stasis. Drink it.

Thank you.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.590
My father saved you.

We saved you again.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.590
It doesn't make sense

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:49.950
if you don't tell the truth.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.430
You're the Young Mistress of Xichuan.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.710
Thank you, Young Mistress

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.130
and you guys.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.000
I, Meng Qin...

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.520
I can't repay you.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.220
I can only...

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:01.710
Stop.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.000
Don't talk empty words.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.480
"I'll remember it"

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.280
"and repay you in the next life." It's nonsense.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:07.670
If someone does you a favor,

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.120
you should try your best

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.010
to repay him.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.360
If you can't repay him,

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.930
you should admit it.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.670
That's what heroes do.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:15.950
I learned a lesson.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.070
So,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.070
you admit you lied to us before, right?

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.310
You were the palace guard

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.400
my father saved.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:27.790
I was seriously injured.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.070
Fortunately, Lord Wen saved me.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:31.710
After I recovered,

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.880
with Lord Wen's help,

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.190
I changed my career.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.240
Before,

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.950
I didn't mean to lie to you.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.500
I don't want others to know

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.160
that I used to be a guard.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.290
All these years,

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.210
I've been living a peaceful life.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.050
But...

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.760
Can you tell me

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:58.880
what you want with me?

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.360
Why do you have the Bird Jade Plate?

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.120
Why...?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.760
Why do you have Mr. Song's

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.160
Cloud-shaped Jade?

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.430
You've got all three pieces of jade.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.650
Who are you?

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.550
Didn't Song Jingye tell you

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.770
who the Royal Army was going

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.070
to escort these things to?

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.520
He did.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.360
We encountered the Raid at that time.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:35.980
Mr. Song told us

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.950
that we had to escape alive

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.160
and give these things

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.910
to Physician Fu in Shangyi.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.240
Are you...?

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.880
My name is Fu Sheng.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.050
The Physician Fu Song Jingye talked about

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.980
was my father.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.790
But he's gone.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.790
I've been carrying the Bird Jade Plate

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.400
since I was a kid.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.120
You have his Cloud-shaped Jade.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.280
You must have seen him.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.360
Why didn't he tell me about it?

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.790
He promised my father to meet him at Xichuan.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.140
We only met once,

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.940
and he died.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.800
Maybe he wanted to tell you.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.000
But he didn't have time.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.910
I only want

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.190
to take care of my son.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.670
Physician Fu.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.040
As long as my wife, son, and I can get out of the city,

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:31.480
I promise

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.480
you will receive something important.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.950
I believe

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.590
that's what you're looking for.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.450
My family is waiting for me.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:48.790
Excuse me.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:54.760
Are we just going to let him go?

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.040
Don't worry. I'll ask Feng Qianli to follow him.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.240
It'll be all right.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.190
Why don't you walk her out?

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:10.360
Leave the door open for me.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.140
[Jibei Chamber of Commerce]

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.310
Fu Sheng and Gu Tian

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.520
took Meng Qin away.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.160
Do they know each other?

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:37.950
Ms. Chairman, do you think

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.360
it's a coincidence?

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.040
I don't think so.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.880
They must have come for the Painting of Luan.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.360
I thought the same.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.080
They are aiming at the Treasure of the Sealed Book.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.150
I don't know

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.560
how many clues they've gotten so far.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.670
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.410
Fu Sheng got the Mountain-shaped Jade

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.630
from the chief of the Tianyi tribe.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.440
In that case,

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.720
they have

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.910
at least one piece of jade.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.670
We need to hurry.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.840
You don't have to tell me.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.390
How long have you been looking for the Bird Jade Plate?

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:17.440
Did you find it?

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.360
You can't blame me for this.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.280
The bounty notice has been issued for a long time.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.340
But there's no clue.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.370
My Lord put the Bird Jade Plate

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:31.720
in the bounty notice.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.480
Was he trying to lure someone out?

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:36.750
Sun Siming.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.790
You're getting bolder.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:40.760
What?

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.640
Does My Lord have to tell you what he's doing?

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.280
No.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.040
Ms. Chairman, you misunderstood me.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.430
I think

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.400
I know too little.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.930
I'm worried that one day,

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.160
the Bird Jade Plate will show up,

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:56.950
and I won't recognize it.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.240
I'm afraid I'll delay My Lord.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.050
Just so you know,

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.000
I'm straightforward.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.440
Maybe I'll say whatever comes into my head

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.040
when I meet My Lord.

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:08.720
Please don't worry.

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:09.960
Are you threatening me?

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.520
I'm not.

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:14.590
I...

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.960
I'm not threatening you.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:20.420
Ms. Chairman.

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.550
You are too thoughtful

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:25.590
and too sensitive.

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:29.760
We both work for My Lord.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.960
Don't play tricks.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.000
A traitor ran away.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.000
The Breakwall took away the Bird Jade Plate.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.390
A few months ago,

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:45.920
all physicians in Shangyi

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.870
were poisoned to death.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.920
That traitor was among them.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.640
My Lord suspected that his descendant

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.070
had left Shangyi for Xichuan

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:56.440
with the Bird Jade Plate.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:17:59.350
Physician.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.240
Shangyi.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.580
Why would the Jibei Chamber of Commerce

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.040
want Meng Qin?

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.280
Do you remember the bounty notice of the Jibei Chamber of Commerce?

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.840
They also want to find the Treasure of the Sealed Book, right?

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.050
There is

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.390
no other possibility.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:26.760
Fu Sheng.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.680
Keep your jade plate

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.880
and three pieces of jade well.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.000
I'm afraid they will come at you.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.760
From now on,

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.680
we have to be careful.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.730
No. I have to go home

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.070
to ask my father to watch out for the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.790
I'll get some help by the way.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:43.810
Why do you want

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.920
to get some help?

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.440
I'm protecting him.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.480
Can you

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.630
deal with so many warriors of the Jibei Chamber of Commerce?

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:52.960
Besides,

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.070
you almost got beheaded last time.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:57.830
I'll leave.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:06.200
I'm telling you.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.440
You have to educate her.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:10.870
She always rubs it in my face.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.390
I have a reputation.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:15.350
Do you think I can help you with this?

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.920
You'd better tell her yourself.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.590
You lost control of your wife.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.740
They are hiding it well.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:30.680
What's wrong?

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.440
What are you thinking about?

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.690
Ms. Chairman, you don't know.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.410
Fu Sheng and Gu Tian are from Shangyi.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.920
I didn't expect them to come out like this.

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:43.550
I went through all this trouble.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.070
But the Bird Jade Plate is just around the corner.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.200
Fu Sheng has the Bird Jade Plate?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.480
Are you sure?

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.920
There's a good chance

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.870
he has it.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.630
It's not just the jade plate.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.040
I'm afraid

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.960
he has the three pieces of jade.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.200
Yin Lie.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.310
Go get him.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.150
Yin.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:07.040
Wait.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:08.760
Ms. Chairman.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.240
If we go catch him,

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.440
we're

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.240
declaring war on Lord Wen.

and killed himself.

Exactly.

that the bag was the only key

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.150
The kind was brilliant.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.350
After he woke up, he became corrupted.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.920
He put the sages in charge of court affairs.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.870
I've heard about it.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.720
I felt odd.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.350
I...

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.110
I even had doubts

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:30.520
about that mission.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.760
I've been secretly investigating for a long time.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:34.550
I suspected

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.680
there was no treasure at all.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:38.520
No treasure?

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.070
What else could there be?

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:41.150
Maybe...

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.000
Maybe that's a secret

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.070
about making the country stable.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.390
When I found out things weren't that simple,

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:51.610
I made a decision.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:53.720
I would hide.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.110
Maybe I wasn't the only one

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.800
who survived.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.630
I wanted to wait for those who had the treasure

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.370
to show up first,

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.240
see what would happen to them,

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:04.760
and then make a plan.

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:07.590
You didn't think you'd wait 20 years.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.790
Yeah.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.350
Twenty years.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.150
After I got married here

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:18.790
and had a son,

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.720
I forgot my mission back then.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.480
So,

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.760
that's the truth of the day.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:29.790
Well.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.390
Do you have the Painting of Luan?

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:34.500
Since I've been hiding my identity for over 20 years,

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:37.930
I won't carry this important thing with me.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.590
I kept the Painting of Luan in a secret place.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.680
And I set traps to protect it.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.790
Without the map,

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:47.280
those who enter the cave will be killed by countless arrows.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.680
My wife and son have the map.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.790
But they were captured by the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.630
If you want the Painting of Luan,

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.240
please rescue my wife and son.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:01.680
You tricked us before.

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.040
Now, you want to use us to rescue your wife and son.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:05.680
You're not sincere.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.150
I...

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.350
Gu Tian is right.

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:10.060
You should hand over the Painting of Luan to Fu Sheng.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:11.720
How can you make a condition?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.350
It's my fault.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.760
But I don't have any other choice.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.350
Please.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.200
Please rescue my wife and son.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:42.730
We have to know where they are

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.760
before we can rescue them.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:47.280
Forget it.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:48.810
I'll check it out

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.280
tonight.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.550

I forbid you to go.

If Sun Siming finds out,

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:56.740
you'll have a problem.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.480
It's a matter of human lives.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.380
Let's rescue them first.

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:01.120
Fu Sheng, listen to her.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:01.920
Don't go.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.240
I forbid you to go as well.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.760
If you get caught,

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.390
we have to exchange the Bird Jade Plate for you.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.440
You can't go.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:09.360
You're going

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.480
over my dead body.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.710
Look at the situation.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:20.840
All right.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.710
You don't have to argue.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.360
I'll go.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.480
It's just probing.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:28.630
I can do it.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.670
But it has nothing to do with you.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.000
We can't get you involved.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.270
I'm the right person to go.

Compared to you,

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:43.960
it will be easier for me

He's been working with me for years.

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:54.000
He can protect himself.

All right.
