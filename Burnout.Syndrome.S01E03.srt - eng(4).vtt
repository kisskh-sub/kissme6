00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.000
You’re going to be Mr. K.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.160
I quit.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.520
You don’t get to.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.800
I’m firing you.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.000
We’re done here.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.960
Bye.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.920
If I have to go back, I’d rather eat shit.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.800
Now I wonder what kind of job it is.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.440
It’s basically scamming.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.600
I had to trick people into
making a deal with me.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.520
It’s awful.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.400
I didn’t expect an IT guy like you
to have a tattoo like that.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.000
You like it?

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.000
I…

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.320
I…

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.320
I’m sorry.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.840
I couldn’t resist.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.200
It’s alright.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.120
Okay.

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.640
Should we get back inside?

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.360
I think I’m gonna go home.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.320
Your shirt might not wash off
if I leave it too long.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.320
Did I… mess up already?

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.720
It’s really alright.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.560
Will I get to see you again?

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.480
If you want to see me,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.360
I’m only one call away.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.760
Happy birthday.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.280
How come you’re still here
when your “partner” went home?

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.760
By this time of the night,
you’re usually at their place.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.840
Hold on.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.360
You make me sound like an ass.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.440
That’s kinda how you come across.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.600
Would you say it’s weird of me

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.080
if I said I want his life to be
even more fucked up,

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.040
just so he keeps coming back to me?

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.680
Not weird.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.080
But that’s such an asshole thing to think.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.880
This is the first time I see you
down bad for someone.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.680
I guess I am down bad.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.960
I don’t know if it’s
the timing or whatever,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.560
but you know how I usually
help people heal?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.720
But with him, I just feel like…

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.280
He’s healing me.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.480
You love him?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.680
Love, my ass.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.280
I just…

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.840
I just want him.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.360
Thank you.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.159
PLEASE RETURN TO KORAWIC KITIWELA

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.920
Mr. Koh.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.160
Yes?

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.040
Mr. Jira sent the suit back.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.000
He asked that we return his clothes.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.920
The clothes are on the bathroom floor.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.840
Send them to him.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.880
Should I put him on the blacklist?

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.159
Not yet.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.280
Here.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.080
Why are you giving me this?

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.240
I don’t want to see it around my room.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.240
It’s an eyesore.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.560
I think…

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.880
This drawing is really good.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.159
It’s even getting me hot.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.240
How dramatic of you.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.560
Did you draw this from a model
or did you imagine it?

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.560
That’s your “gray market” business owner.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.880
“Someone as lia-hoo as you can keep
living in your rotten room.”

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.280
What does “lia-hoo” mean?

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.880
(Lia-hoo is a Lu language,)

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.080
(a language used amongst
the LGBTQ+ community.)

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.840
(It means a jerk.)

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.120
Korawic Kitiwela.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.240
These are your undies?

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.480
Yeah.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.880
Weird.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.280
Perverted, even.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.800
Korawic…

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.160
Crap!

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.440
He owns Hive?

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.440
What?

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.200
This is the first I’ve heard of this.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.640
Well, damn.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.280
Now that’s a “gray market,” indeed.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.320
Oh?

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.320
What are you doing here?

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.200
I’m here to talk to you.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.760
Mr. Butler told me you’d be here.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.920
Is this about your department?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.640
Yes.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.560
Let’s have a race.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.440
If you win,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.280
I’ll think about it.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.640
“Korawic’s attorney made a clarification at
the Department of Special Investigation.”

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.520
What the hell?

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.440
What?

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.320
You didn’t watch the news?

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.760
Where do you think these new money
from startups get their money?

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.640
They’re all laundering money.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.280
How does he look in person?

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.600
He looks like a jerk.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.480
Who cares about that?

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.680
You should stick close to him
since he’s filthy rich.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.320
What’s got into you?

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.920
You’re contradicting yourself.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.760
Look at this.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.160
What about it?

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.880
When was the last time you drew anything
as remotely authentic as this?

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.520
I think he could be our muse.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.120
You get paid. You have a job.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.680
Go back and beg him right now.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.560
Tell him you’re willing to do anything.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.880
I’m here to see Mr. Korawic.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.760
Which room?

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:30.960
The penthouse suite.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.360
We don’t have a guest in that room.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:38.840
What?

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.280
How could that be?

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.880
I saw him just yesterday.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.360
Can you please recheck?

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:44.880
Oh?

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.840
Mr. Butler.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.320
Ask Mr. Butler if you don’t believe me.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.280
I was here to see Mr. Koh yesterday,
wasn’t I?

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.480
I checked and there was no one there—

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.680
Check again.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.040
It’s alright.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.680
Mr. Jira, please follow me here.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.360
I won.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.080
Don’t you bail on me.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:28.960
Yeah.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:30.960
I won’t.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.880
I knew I was going to lose.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:35.880
What?

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.520
What’s that?

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.040
You remember when we were kids?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.240
No matter how many times we tried,

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.640
you never won in any of these races.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.560
But since you’re so damn tall now,

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.400
you can probably reach the other side
of the pool in two strokes.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.160
If you knew you were gonna lose,

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.520
why did you ask me to compete with you?

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.440
I know I’m tough on you.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.880
But I feel like
we can’t talk like we used to.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.440
I don’t know if it’s because of me,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.360
or you,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.200
but it’s just so freaking tragic.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.840
It’s because of you, you jerk.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.960
The suit you returned,
I have given it to Mr. Koh.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.400
Your message, however…

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.880
I decided to withhold it.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.160
Sheltered, isn’t he?

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.160
To think my insult did not even reach him.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.120
This is part of my duties.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.360
But the reason I do this

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.560
is partly because I don’t want
the two of you to have bad blood.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.840
I have a feeling you’re special to him.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.480
What?

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.840
You call this special?

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.280
I do.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:10.040
Usually, anyone who’s been to
Mr. Koh’s room would be blacklisted.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.120
Not many people have made it otherwise.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.680
Hello, Mr. Koh.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.280
Mr. Jira is here to see you.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.680
This way, please.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.120
Hey.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.280
Did you have to close
the entire pool for this?

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:03.840
Who’s this?

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.320
Your friend?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.520
Yes.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:07.960
My friend.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.960
You should go.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.920
I need to talk to Mr. K.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.800
I want to do this awful job.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.040
There’s no “lia-hoo” awful job for you.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.920
Then, I’d like to work with
a “lia-hoo” person.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.880
Unfortunately, I am an angel.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.520
Hey.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.200
Just tell me what you want.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.160
Give me a reason
why I should take you back.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.760
You’re showing me my own nude.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.160
Don’t you think this is messed up?

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.720
Listen.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.280
It’s art.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.560
Don’t take it the wrong way.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.120
You literally drew me in nude.
How else should I take it?

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.560
I follow my emotions.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.080
Do you like it?

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.560
Let’s cut to the chase.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.200
Do you want to come back to work

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.240
or for something else?

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.040
I’m asking you if you like this drawing.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.720
Before this, my drawings never quite
live up to my expectations,

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.640
and I’ve been feeling burnt out.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.080
But ever since I met you,
my drawings seem to feel better.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.480
I want you to be my model.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.040
Are you messing with me?

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.000
Listen to me.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.400
Be my model, and I’ll be your Mr. K.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.800
I don’t mind if you pay me less.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.800
We can start tomorrow.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.480
Why should I accept an unreasonable offer?

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.000
Ugh, you don’t need a reason
for everything.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.040
This is emotion-based.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.240
You get something out of this deal
as an employer,

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.120
and I get something as an employee.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.360
What do you say?

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.160
Well, what do you say?

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.000
Fine.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.240
I’ll give it a try.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.480
On one condition,

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.320
whatever I order you to do,
you will cause no drama,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.080
no empathy,

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.680
no giving in.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.320
And no arguing.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:42.720
Understood?

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.440
Understood.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:10.880
You’re still here.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:13.040
I was waiting for you.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.319
What a coincidence.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.839
Who’d think we’d be working
at the same company?

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.040
I know, right?

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.160
I had a feeling when we were
both slamming our bosses.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.160
What do you do for him?

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.880
I signed an NDA.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.680
I can’t tell you.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.560
I don’t want to get arrested.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.800
I understand.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.680
Why did you wait for me?

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.160
Well…

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.600
Are you mad at me?

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.680
You said you’d call but you didn’t.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:49.840
I’m not.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.960
I was busy with work.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.240
I swear I really am not mad at you.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.280
Okay.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.520
So are we…

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.640
Are we close now?

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.240
Hmm.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.920
Since we’re close, and now colleagues,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.600
can I just talk casually?

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.360
Of course.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.320
I’m gonna grab lunch.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.640
You wanna come with?

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.880
My treat, of course.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.760
We can talk about work.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.960
Let’s not talk about work.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.680
It’s time to let loose.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.120
I didn’t know you like 2000’s music.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.840
We grew up in the same decades, you know?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.720
You don’t like it?

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:49.760
Sorry?

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.320
Don’t you like it?

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.120
Oh, I love it.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.920
I feel it in my soul, in fact.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.360
You sure you’re not just saying that
to please me?

Alright.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:02.840
Here.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.800
Thanks.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.360
Pheem.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.680
How long have you worked with Koh?

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.160
Nearly 20 years, I think.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.080
If you count helping him
with his homework in third grade.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.160
Wow.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.360
For real?

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.360
Our dynamic is quite strange.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.200
It’s a love-hate friendship.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.920
At school events,
like maths-science contests,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.960
academic competitions, spelling bee,

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.320
or sports events,

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:40.080
the whole school just knew he and I
would be competing as the finalists.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.120
That’s a smooth way of showing off.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:47.960
But…

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.400
When we’re not competing, we’re fine.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.440
I always went to his place,
and his parents were always so nice to me.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.760
I was like a son to them.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.920
His parents sound wonderful.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.320
How come they raised
such a hellish person?

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.640
He isn’t always
this dark cloud of a person.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.000
He got like that in high school.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.680
His parents went broke.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.680
And he turned into this person.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:20.960
Let’s say,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.160
if you want to be successful
in this business like Koh,

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.360
you have to be heartless.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.080
I happen to be full of heart.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.600
So I can’t do what he does.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:33.760
That’s it.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.520
Can I keep this drawing?

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.640
You want it?

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.120
Yes, I do.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.320
How much would you sell it?

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.240
If you want it, I’ll give it to you.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.240
I don’t want to just take it.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.360
Pay me its worth, then.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.280
Here.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.160
Is this your first time?

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:20.920
What?

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.960
You’ve never sold your art before,
have you?

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.560
What about it?

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.520
Wait.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.600
Can you frame this for me?

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.800
Of course, sir.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.160
This is your new dose of prescription.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.160
Thank you.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.560
JIRA

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:02.920
Yes?

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:04.680
Hey.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.960
I can finally return you the money
I borrowed.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.880
Where did you get it?

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.200
I sold my art.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.320
Which one?

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.440
That drawing of Koh.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:16.840
(Who bought it?)

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.280
Koh did.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.600
(Congratulations.)

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.800
(Things are only looking up from here.)

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.080
(Are you crying?)

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.520
Why are you crying, you silly?

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.520
Thank you so much

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.960
for helping me out.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.520
(Take it easy.)

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.800
(You just sold a piece of art,
not hailed as the national artist.)

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:54.200
I can stop doubting if I’m talentless.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.520
See?

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:56.960
I told you.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.640
You and he are destined to meet.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.600
(Don’t do anything to lose
his connection, then.)

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:04.840
Yeah.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.280
I’ll try.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.800
What are you doing here?

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.400
Did you hit your head?

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.400
We agreed I’d come by to sketch you.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:02.960
Did you forget?

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:05.680
I did.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.280
Stop messing around.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.000
I’m not.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.440
I’m really not alright today.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.880
Are you okay?

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:24.600
Hey.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.800
I needed that.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:37.880
Are you sure you’re okay?

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.880
Should I call your butler?

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:43.760
No.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.520
It’s just the side effects of
the new sleeping pill.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.640
Let’s just get it done.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.800
Where should I stand? How should I pose?

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.000
No.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.000
You don’t need to pose.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.200
Just relax.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.040
Do whatever you do when you’re at home.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.040
Pretend I’m not here.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.480
Poof.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.280
Don’t stare.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.240
Don’t mind me.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.400
I’m just a fly on your wall.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.200
Can you grab a towel for me?

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.120
Don’t forget I’m not even here.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.600
Why?

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:49.880
Embarrassed?

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:53.800
Yeah.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.400
No need to.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.680
You said I was like air when we first met.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.080
You don’t feel a thing, you said.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.000
I didn’t know you then.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.400
But now I do.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.680
Do you always wear a bathrobe?

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:35.920
Oh?

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.520
Why don’t you just finish it?

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.520
You’re not relaxed.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.640
I need to keep sketching.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.600
If you just try to be at ease
like that first day we met,

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.000
this will turn out okay.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.000
So can you just relax?

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.400
Before you blame me,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.880
blame your own ability.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.680
How about this?

00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.640
When you were a kid,

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.720
was there anything you did
that made you feel comfortable?

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.520
Would you believe me if I told you?

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.880
I liked folding laundry.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:13.880
Folding laundry?

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.760
Doesn’t sound like you.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.400
But I’d like to see it.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.440
Where should we do this?

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.800
Why are there only boring clothes?

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.600
With all your money,

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.440
you should buy yourself some taste.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.440
It’s my money, you know.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.640
Did your mom teach you?

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.040
The uncles and aunties did.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.200
Uncles and aunties?

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.440
The uncles and aunties
at my parents’ old factory.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.640
I see.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.800
It was an old clothing factory.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.080
I was wondering how you knew
how to take measurements.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.280
So you have a delicate side, after all.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.240
Why don’t you bring it out more often?

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.520
People will take advantage of me
if I’m weak.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.280
Isn’t that too much?

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.680
You can talk to me, you know?

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.280
I don’t want to.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.800
Then this is it for today.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.840
If you don’t open up, I can’t draw.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.400
You said these clothes are boring.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.600
You know what’s so good about it?

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.040
It’s machine-made, not handmade.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.600
Ever since my family went bankrupt,

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.640
I never wore anything tailor-made again.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.840
Because it makes me miss
the people who made them.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.680
And?

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.280
My parents are the type to…

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:02.800
What can I say?

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.800
They were too kind.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:10.120
No matter the economy,
whether or not their clothes sold,

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.280
they’d still keep all of their employees.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.400
Our company could no longer
support all of us,

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.640
and we had to sell it
to some bigger companies.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.440
Thames?

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.280
He was one of the vultures.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.560
But it taught me to never trust
someone too much.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.880
People are unpredictable.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.400
They make mistakes,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.040
a lot of mistakes.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.800
Betrayals happen daily.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.480
So you’re taking revenge.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.800
I wouldn’t do something so emotional.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.000
It’s just all business.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.680
It’s all logical.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.679
When I was young,

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.080
I’d always sneak off from my mom
to play in a pile of clothes.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.520
It was so comfortable.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.400
In the afternoon, it’d get hot,

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.080
and I’d grown tired.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:26.719
With a fan on,

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:30.400
it was beyond comfy.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.880
I’d fall asleep.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.719
You look really relaxed lying in
that pile of clothes

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.320
more than you ever do
when you do anything logical.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.600
Don’t be a know-it-all.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.679
No matter where I sleep,

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.040
none has been as comfortable
as when I was a kid.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.640
Since I’ve become an adult,

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.520
I don’t think I’ve ever gotten
a proper sleep again.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.280
Why?

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.520
Work got to you?

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.640
Don’t waste time prying things out of me.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.840
It’s your turn.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.120
Why do you want to draw me?

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.200
Honestly?

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.720
I get horny when I draw you.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.880
You’re the first person who bought my art.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.000
What did you see in it?

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:50.560
Hey.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.840
You’re the first person who bought my art.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:35:59.680
Hey.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.440
Hey.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:11.600
Hey.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.720
And he said he couldn’t sleep.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.720
He seems to sleep just fine to me.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:52.520
Hey.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.800
I’m done with the drawing.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.600
I’m going home, then.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:40.880
Hello?

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.800
I’m off work early.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.400
Can I come see you?

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:45.920
Of course.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.560
Can you meet me at my office?

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:49.400
(Hmm.)

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.680
(Send me your location.)

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.280
Okay. See you.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.120
Look at that.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.680
A frown turned upside down.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.520
Well, your face looks like a whole frown.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.440
What happened?

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.400
Who’s coming?

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.160
None of your business.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:45.880
Yo.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.000
I have something for you.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:54.000
Here.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.800
I saved some music
on this flashdrive for you

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.400
when I knew you like 2000’s music.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.000
You can listen to it while you’re working.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.400
Crap.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.040
Really?

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.880
I selected only the ones
I knew you’d like.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.400
You’re too cute.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.200
Why a flashdrive, though?

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:17.600
Well…

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.600
It’s very 2000’s-coded.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.800
You’re thoughtful, you know that?

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.040
Only with people I care about.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:34.680
Well…

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.000
Wanna come to my place tonight?

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.680
Why… all of a sudden?

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.880
You made me a playlist.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.200
We should listen to it together.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.440
Do you…

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.200
have a cat at home?

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:02.800
No cats.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.400
But I do have a stereo.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.080
It's amazing.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:12.600
You up for some special music sesh?

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.240
Your stereo is as amazing as you claimed.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.200
You want to try it?

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.080
Come sit here.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.920
You know why I like the song Jealous?

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.040
Why? Is it because it’s famous?

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:10.880
No.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.320
Because I’m the jealous type.

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.320
I love the baseline.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:19.800
Can we turn the volume up?

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.280
Not too loud.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.640
We don’t want
the neighbor knocking, do we?

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:06.960
Who was that?

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:08.920
Koh.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.640
Won’t you take it?

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.000
It’s off-hours.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.440
You’re the real deal, huh.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.800
I can’t do that.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.120
I always take his calls.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:29.600
Look at me.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.720
Do I look like I’m scared of him?

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.080
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.480
But you told me to look.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.920
You have flirty eyes.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.600
Do you do this with everyone?

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.800
If I told you

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.400
that you’re the only one I do this with,

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.400
would you believe me?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.520
KOH

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:42.920
I think you need to take it.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.800
Could be important.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.320
Hello?

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.440
Where are you?

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:04.920
I’m with my friend.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.640
Come see me right now.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:07.720
Hey.

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.400
You need to respect my boundaries.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.000
(You’re working me too much!)

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.720
I’ll pay you more if you want.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.280
(But you need to come to me right now.)

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.520
Otherwise, our deal is off.

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:23.520
Well?

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
(Are you coming or not?)

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:28.680
Fine.

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:29.800
Damn it!

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.200
What is this about?

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
What do you want me for?

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.000
Follow me.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.040
You’re sleeping with me tonight.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:14.920
Get in bed.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.040
So you want me to sleep with you?

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.040
Can you do it?

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.600
I think you’re like this because of Koh.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.120
You like him.

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.440
I don’t like him.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.760
How could I like someone so awful?

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.520
Oh, please. That’s your type.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.040
His red flags get you excited, don’t they?

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.480
I want to see him again.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.840
I don’t ever feel like that with anyone.

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.240
This is the first time
you’re ghosted on, isn’t it?

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.960
I just want to know how you feel about me.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.200
Are you hitting on me?
