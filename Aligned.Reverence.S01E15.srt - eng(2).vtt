(I Like You)

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.380
Shopkeeper.

00:00:16.337 --> 00:00:17.499
Why did you agree before,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.300
yet refuse to sell to me now?

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.060
To be honest with you,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.219
a few days ago,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.779
another buyer placed a deposit.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.940
She offered a high price

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.580
and asked me to keep the rice
for her alone.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.380
Until when?

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.174
I think the new rice harvest

00:00:34.175 --> 00:00:35.975
will be ready in a month.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.819
By then,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.220
this old stock of yours

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.290
won't fetch a high price anymore.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.820
Let me see who dares steal my business.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.979
I buy rice

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.899
to provide relief

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.100
for the orphans of Xiao army
who died in battle.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.419
How?

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.460
Will you join me as well?

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.780
Are you mad?

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.379
Just for charity,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.132
you sold off your shops?

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.061
I'm telling you,

00:01:13.062 --> 00:01:15.361
don't throw away
the Su family's few remaining assets

00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:17.070
just to spite me.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.620
Su Xinyue.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.820
Do you want to win Xie Yunyan over?

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.220
I do.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.900
Then do exactly as I say.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.179
Everything you're doing

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.900
is to win favor with
the Xiao family and Yan, isn't it?

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.979
If you can do it,

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.500
why can't I?

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.300
I promise you this,

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.020
from now on
you won't get a single grain of rice.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.220
As I recall, the Su family
isn't that wealthy.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.619
These banknotes...

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.139
Could it be Second Uncle

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.820
earned them through corruption?

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.539
How dare you slander my father!

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.460
I...

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.820
Are you alright?

00:02:38.312 --> 00:02:39.432
I'm fine.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.580
Fine.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.319
I knew it.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.520
How could Young Master Xie
possibly not like me?

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.250
Su Jinyuan.

00:02:51.287 --> 00:02:53.524
As the Young Madam,
you seduce your Brother-in-law?

00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:55.125
Do you have no shame?

00:02:57.562 --> 00:02:59.002
Su Xinyue.

00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:00.859
Did you forget

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.620
the warning I gave you?

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.780
Su Jinyuan.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.660
Ask yourself honestly,

00:03:11.387 --> 00:03:12.987
are you truly innocent?

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.220
Yan, no.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.940
You

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.059
hadn't fully recovered.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.820
Why run out like this?

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.579
Fortunately Yan was here today,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.220
or you would have suffered for it.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.020
Yan.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.724
You've been absent-minded lately.

00:03:57.725 --> 00:03:58.924
Is it because Su Xinyue

00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:00.485
keeps pestering you?

00:04:06.027 --> 00:04:06.786
But Yan,

00:04:06.787 --> 00:04:09.180
it is indeed time for you
to discuss marriage.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.340
Grandmother and Mother talked it over.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.336
It is kind of you to keep mourning
for the Xiao family,

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:17.337
but you need not
delay marriage because of it.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.311
You're closest
to the Young Madam in daily life.

00:04:20.312 --> 00:04:22.552
You should help pick
a good match for him.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.940
I will help find a good match for Yan.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.220
Yan, what kind of woman do you like?

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.807
Tell us.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.419
Thank you, Sisters-in-law.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.060
But right now,

00:04:43.062 --> 00:04:44.382
I have no heart for marriage.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.780
Could it be Yan is shy?

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.620
Young Master.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.949
These young ladies

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.300
were specially picked
by the Young Madam for you.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.820
You must look carefully.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.259
Come.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.580
Young Master, look.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.499
This lady is the daughter
of the Vice Minister of Justice,

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.420
righteous and valiant in nature.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.020
And here.

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:22.899
The younger sister
of a Hanlin Academy scholar.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.060
She is known as
the most talented lady in the capital.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.700
Take a look.

00:05:31.975 --> 00:05:33.295
A valiant lady.

00:05:34.987 --> 00:05:36.107
A gifted scholar.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.299
Each has her own charm.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.940
Quite hard to choose.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:46.861
Young Master.

00:05:46.862 --> 00:05:47.974
Do not drink anymore.

00:05:47.975 --> 00:05:49.539
The Young Madam reminded you especially.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.699
You must choose carefully.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.820
Look again.

00:05:52.762 --> 00:05:53.882
Fine.

00:06:12.062 --> 00:06:14.382
(Feiwan Pavilion)

00:06:42.475 --> 00:06:43.795
You have been drinking?

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.140
Do you really

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.540
want me to marry someone else?

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.539
If you do not wish it,

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.660
I can stay out of the matter.

00:07:03.725 --> 00:07:05.165
Stay out of it?

00:07:06.975 --> 00:07:09.895
From the moment
you broke into that prison,

00:07:10.775 --> 00:07:12.615
in my heart,

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.940
you could no longer leave.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.260
You once told me

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.220
to look for someone I like.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.100
Yet the one I like is you.

00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:33.525
I am fond of you.

00:07:34.137 --> 00:07:36.257
And you are the one I wish to marry.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.580
Were you not the one

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.180
trying to arrange my marriage?

00:07:52.112 --> 00:07:54.352
Then why not marry yourself to me?

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.460
Xie Yunyan!

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.420
Clear your mind.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.460
Forgive me.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.700
It is just

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.900
truly fond of you.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.940
Xie Yunyan.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.260
Remember this.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.180
I can only be your Sister in law.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.459
No, Yan.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.900
No.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.860
No.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.682
Since you wish me to marry,

00:09:44.725 --> 00:09:46.365
then I shall marry.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.340
Yuan.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.460
I like you.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.540
When one loves another,

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.420
it simply cannot be hidden.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.660
Yuan.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.460
You were never truly my Sister in law.

00:10:46.025 --> 00:10:47.745
The annulment letter exists.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.100
You clearly

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.180
have feelings for me as well.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.700
You like me, and you know it.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.045
Yan.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.624
Little Yuan has always
carried heavy worries.

00:11:15.625 --> 00:11:16.825
Her heart is knotted.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.195
Now her fever still will not fall.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:22.980
Watch over her.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.460
I will decoct her medicine.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.580
Yuan.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.280
It is all my fault.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.300
I should not have upset you.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.500
I was wrong.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.220
Yan.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.557
Do not be afraid.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.282
I am here.

00:13:14.825 --> 00:13:15.945
Yuan.

00:13:19.212 --> 00:13:21.172
I still cannot let you go.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.020
So let me

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.420
stay by your side like this.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.540
Please?

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.420
Grandmother.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.860
Yan.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.900
What happened?

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.580
Jinyuan

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.100
has a fever.

00:14:04.925 --> 00:14:06.485
She really is burning up.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.380
How did this happen?

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.220
She must have been bullied by Su Xinyue.

00:14:21.675 --> 00:14:23.475
Were you not present?

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.740
How could you fail to protect her?

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.060
It was not Su Xinyue.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.380
It was me.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.740
What did you say?

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.900
I was the one who upset her.

00:14:47.725 --> 00:14:49.005
You mean...

00:14:49.487 --> 00:14:51.847
You angered your Sister-in-law
until she fell ill?

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:53.619
You...

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.882
You will be the end of me!

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.539
Ungrateful child.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.619
I let you run wild.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.460
You are a grown man,

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.311
yet you upset

00:15:06.312 --> 00:15:07.820
a girl who cannot even fight back.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.500
After all these years,
is this what you learned?

00:15:10.737 --> 00:15:11.459
Out.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:12.860
Kneel under the corridor.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:13.961
When Yuan wakes up,

00:15:13.962 --> 00:15:15.642
I will deal with you again.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.900
Grandmother.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.780
You are awake.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.900
I already know Yan bullied you.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:56.940
Grandmother...

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.499
Yan and I...

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.739
Alright, enough.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:00.900
Lie back down.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.539
That brat,

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.020
I have punished him.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.299
How dare he raise his hand to you?

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.660
He must have lost his mind.

00:16:19.212 --> 00:16:21.292

Alright.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.499
I will send him away.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.380
He will not disturb you again.
