He was injured
when he was imprisoned before.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.459
Later, he was flogged by His Majesty.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.339
Three ribs were broken and displaced.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.420

When I insert the needles,
he must not collapse.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.870

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.299
So many wounds on him,

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.980
yet he acts as if nothing happened.

00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:27.745
No one knows how he endured it.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.540

is not so simple.

00:08:33.462 --> 00:08:34.942
Do not worry.

00:08:35.662 --> 00:08:37.459
I will petition His Majesty myself

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.500
and demand justice.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.539
(Your Majesty,)

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.380
(I present my plea
with grief in my heart.)

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.739
(My husband and son)

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.099
(did not fall in battle.)

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.060
(They were murdered by traitors.)

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.699
(Their schemes)

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.299
(wounded the Xiao family
and defied the law.)

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.419
(They deceived Your Majesty.)

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.659
(I beg Your Majesty to investigate.)

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.139
(Punish the culprits severely,)

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.260
(to bring peace to the loyal spirits.)

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.579
Since the Grand Madam
of the Xiao family has a request,

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.540
His Majesty will surely grant her favor.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.300
Our Xiao family has served the realm
with loyalty for three generations.

00:09:24.425 --> 00:09:27.782
How could mere gold
and silver repay such sacrifice?

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.107
What we seek is the truth.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.819
Grand Madam.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.780
Please focus on your recovery.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.060
Do not trouble His Majesty further.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.657
Mother.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.379
Grandmother.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.739
Let me help you back to rest.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.580
Come.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.940
Slowly.

00:09:50.687 --> 00:09:52.927
If His Majesty refuses justice
for the Xiao family,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.180
then justice for the Xiao family,

00:09:55.425 --> 00:09:56.939
I will claim myself.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.980
Xie Yunyan.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.900
Do not act rashly.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.845
This matter is far from simple.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.910
We must plan with care.

00:10:08.687 --> 00:10:10.487
The Xiao family has suffered calamity.

00:10:11.012 --> 00:10:12.292
The women of the Xiao household

00:10:12.562 --> 00:10:14.082
still need my protection.

00:10:15.275 --> 00:10:16.955
I will not act out of impulse.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.190
Good.

00:10:19.275 --> 00:10:20.795
As for the truth behind Linchuan's case,

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:22.867
I will do all I can to help you.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.220
Young Madam.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.939
Young Madam.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.660
Someone from your
maiden family has arrived.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.895
(Xiao Manor)

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.579
The Duke Protector's residence

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.260
truly lives up to its grandeur.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.339
Had I known the Xiao family
would be vindicated,

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.300
I should have stayed here
and never left.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.019
All of this now

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.580
should have been mine to begin with.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.499
Mother.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.580
You must stand up for me.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.100
Do not worry.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.379
This matter is no longer up to her.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.499
This time,

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.420
she will not get away with any schemes.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.579
Besides,

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.059
we have leverage over her now.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.860
She dare not refuse.

00:11:04.887 --> 00:11:06.139
Did I not say

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.220
I have severed all ties
with the Su family?

00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:09.815
Why have you come again?

00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:11.920
Yuan.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.819
I

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.344
came today especially to apologize.

00:11:15.345 --> 00:11:16.624
We are all family,

00:11:16.625 --> 00:11:18.985
why let things be so unpleasant?

00:11:20.037 --> 00:11:22.099
So Second Aunt came to apologize?

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.507
Then go on, I am listening.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.620
Did I not say it just now?

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.580
That is not how one apologizes.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.540
You should say,

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.260
stealing my parents' estate

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.407
was despicable of you.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.861
Letting Su Xinyue take my betrothal

00:11:42.862 --> 00:11:45.142
was shameless of you.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.424
Letting Lu Zhuo deceive and ruin me

00:11:47.425 --> 00:11:49.265
was vile beyond compare.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.860
Selling my younger brother

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.859
was utterly inhuman of you.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.500
Su Jinyuan, do not go too far.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.820
Yuan.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.060
I am actually here to help you.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.161
The Xiao family will have much
to rely on Sixth Young Master Xie

00:12:06.162 --> 00:12:08.522
for in the days to come.

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:10.619
If he marries someone unworthy,

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.482
your life as a widow will be difficult.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.899
But if...

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.460
If you let Sixth Young Master Xie
marry Su Xinyue,

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.379
then you could
work inside and out together

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.100
and drain
the Xiao family clean, is that it?

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.459
If you marry our Xinyue

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.579
to Xie Yunyan,

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.259
you will not suffer any loss.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.481
You sisters could join hands,

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:31.711
share wealth and glory,
would that not be wonderful?

00:12:31.712 --> 00:12:33.420
But I do not agree.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.020
And why not?

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.139
For my sixth brother fought
through life and death

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.220
to buy peace for the Xiao family.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.900
As long as I remain
Young Madam of the Xiao family,

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.580
people like you

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.245
will never step
through the Xiao family gates.

00:12:58.937 --> 00:13:00.857
Have you forgotten, Sister?

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.624
It was you, with your own hand,

00:13:06.625 --> 00:13:08.357
who killed Lu Zhuo with this.

00:13:12.575 --> 00:13:15.382
Lu Zhuo's body
was found in the old temple.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.580
The coroner examined him.
He died from a blade to the throat.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.340
Yes.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.620
I killed him.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.060
So?

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.819
- You want to die as well?
- What do you think you're doing?

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.100
- Aren't you afraid we'll report you?
- Go on then.

00:13:48.875 --> 00:13:50.315
If I die,

00:13:50.637 --> 00:13:53.677
I'll make sure your whole family
goes down with me.
