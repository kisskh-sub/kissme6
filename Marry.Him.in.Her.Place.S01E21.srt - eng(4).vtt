(Liang's Apothecary)

00:01:22.272 --> 00:01:23.511
What happened?

00:01:23.512 --> 00:01:25.231
They came in

00:01:25.232 --> 00:01:27.471
and just grabbed everything of value.

00:01:27.472 --> 00:01:30.151
Who would dare cause trouble
in the apothecary in broad daylight?

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:31.431
The shareholders.

00:01:31.432 --> 00:01:32.551
The shareholders?

00:01:32.552 --> 00:01:34.071
Things have gone downhill

00:01:34.072 --> 00:01:36.111
ever since Master Liang passed.

00:01:36.112 --> 00:01:38.911
Things finally started turning around
after you came back.

00:01:38.912 --> 00:01:40.071
But yesterday,

00:01:40.072 --> 00:01:41.751
the founding shareholders
suddenly announced

00:01:41.752 --> 00:01:43.671
they were pulling out as a group.

00:01:43.672 --> 00:01:45.471
They demanded 5,000 silver dollars.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:46.386
I checked the books.

00:01:46.387 --> 00:01:48.506
Even if we emptied every account,

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:50.471
we could scrape together
maybe 3,000 at most.

00:01:50.472 --> 00:01:51.471
That's far from enough.

00:01:51.472 --> 00:01:54.024
Showing up at daybreak to cause a mess,

00:01:54.025 --> 00:01:56.025
it could only be them.

00:01:58.232 --> 00:01:59.311
You're pulling out?

00:01:59.312 --> 00:02:00.511
Why?

00:02:00.512 --> 00:02:02.831
You still have the nerve to ask why?

00:02:02.832 --> 00:02:04.524
The profits have dropped

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.445
to a pathetic state.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.689
We only put money in

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.570
because we respected your father.

00:02:10.575 --> 00:02:12.711
With your father gone,

00:02:12.712 --> 00:02:15.271
the reason for our partnership
is gone as well.

00:02:15.272 --> 00:02:17.311
You think a little girl like you

00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:19.271
can run a business?

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:20.712
Stop dreaming.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:25.071
I am the rightful head
of the Liang family now.

00:02:25.072 --> 00:02:27.112
You should watch your tone.

00:02:29.592 --> 00:02:30.551
Also,

00:02:30.552 --> 00:02:32.991
do not drag your past dealings
with my father into this.

00:02:32.992 --> 00:02:36.991
If not for him, you'd still be out there
wondering where your next meal was coming from.

00:02:36.992 --> 00:02:38.191
Just give us

00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:39.391
the money

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:40.592
and we'll leave.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.632
And if I refuse?

00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:45.992
Then, we'll help ourselves.

00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:53.686
The apothecary

00:02:53.687 --> 00:02:55.936
couldn't have been
making money every year.

00:02:55.937 --> 00:02:58.271
All of you acting in such perfect unison

00:02:58.272 --> 00:03:00.591
couldn't have happened by itself.

00:03:00.592 --> 00:03:02.552
Someone must be pulling strings.

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.911
You've made plenty
from the Liang family.

00:03:21.912 --> 00:03:23.471
Give me one month.

00:03:23.472 --> 00:03:24.711
If I can't fill the gap

00:03:24.712 --> 00:03:26.911
and turn things around

00:03:26.912 --> 00:03:28.511
within that time,

00:03:28.512 --> 00:03:30.752
do whatever you want.

00:03:31.432 --> 00:03:33.312
If I can,

00:03:33.472 --> 00:03:35.111
we continue as usual

00:03:35.112 --> 00:03:37.511
and pretend this never happened.

00:03:37.512 --> 00:03:41.072
I'll even add 1% profit as compensation.

00:03:54.552 --> 00:03:57.445
Do not let her sweet talk fool you.

00:04:03.392 --> 00:04:04.992
And here comes the puppeteer.

00:04:15.592 --> 00:04:18.311
There are 5,000 silver dollars
in this case.

00:04:18.312 --> 00:04:20.511
I'll buy

00:04:20.512 --> 00:04:21.791
all

00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:23.272
your shares.

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:28.071
Mr. Lin, are you serious?

00:04:28.072 --> 00:04:29.724
Do I have a deal

00:04:29.725 --> 00:04:31.036
or not?

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:31.736
Yes.

00:04:31.737 --> 00:04:32.624
I'll do it.

00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:33.749
Me too.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.030
Count me in.

00:04:35.262 --> 00:04:37.111
You people must have a death wish,

00:04:37.112 --> 00:04:38.832
taking money from Chengyun Society.

00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:47.911
I don't know what Mr. Lin promised you,

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.512
but from what I know,

00:04:49.737 --> 00:04:52.777
the Chengyun Society's money
comes with a price.

00:04:53.912 --> 00:04:55.686
You might keep it now,

00:04:55.687 --> 00:04:58.049
but can you keep it forever?

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.071
How many have taken a bit of profit

00:05:00.072 --> 00:05:02.191
only to cough it back ten
or a hundred times over?

00:05:02.192 --> 00:05:05.871
Have you not heard the stories?
You don't even need to look far.

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:09.751
Surely you all know
how the Dai family lost

00:05:09.752 --> 00:05:11.312
their 13 shops.

00:05:13.672 --> 00:05:16.871
Miss Liang, you seem to think
you know Chengyun Society

00:05:16.872 --> 00:05:18.591
so well.

00:05:18.592 --> 00:05:20.974
Even if I don't know

00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:23.191
the Chengyun Society or you,

00:05:23.192 --> 00:05:25.512
I'm sure the investors do.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.780
We'll return and discuss this matter.

00:05:42.112 --> 00:05:44.591
Miss Liang,

00:05:44.592 --> 00:05:48.392
I see you're determined
to do this the hard way.

00:05:48.752 --> 00:05:49.951
Men,

00:05:49.952 --> 00:05:51.932
bring them all back.

00:05:59.312 --> 00:06:01.831
Mayor Song has become
the provincial chairman.

00:06:01.832 --> 00:06:05.431
As the wealthiest merchants
in Rong City, you should set an example,

00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:07.911
support the chairman's work,

00:06:07.912 --> 00:06:11.792
and contribute
to Jiangzhou's development and defense.

00:06:13.212 --> 00:06:14.451
We're living in turbulent times,

00:06:14.452 --> 00:06:16.561
yet you can still make money in safety.

00:06:16.562 --> 00:06:18.361
Learn to be grateful.

00:06:18.362 --> 00:06:20.201
This isn't a request for donations.

00:06:20.202 --> 00:06:21.671
This is robbery.

00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:24.152
Every business under the Lu family
is covered in that agreement.

00:06:28.587 --> 00:06:29.587
What are you doing?

00:06:51.212 --> 00:06:53.400
I was beginning to see
why your mouth gets you in trouble.

00:06:53.837 --> 00:06:55.677
Seems your teeth grew crooked.

00:07:03.137 --> 00:07:05.245

(Recipient: Lin Yun)

00:07:12.552 --> 00:07:14.672
You're a sensible man, Mr. Wang.

00:07:15.992 --> 00:07:16.991
Come on.

00:07:16.992 --> 00:07:18.332
Bring in the banner.

00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:25.336
(Presented to Mr. Wang)

00:07:25.337 --> 00:07:27.376
Honored citizen of Jiangzhou,

00:07:27.377 --> 00:07:29.551
respected figure of Rong City.

00:07:29.552 --> 00:07:31.311
Congratulations, Mr. Wang.

00:07:31.312 --> 00:07:33.232
Can I go now?

00:07:34.072 --> 00:07:35.512
Of course. Take care.

00:07:38.472 --> 00:07:40.271
You can earn back lost money.

00:07:40.272 --> 00:07:41.711
However, if you lose your life,

00:07:41.712 --> 00:07:43.232
you lose everything.

00:07:45.087 --> 00:07:46.447
You're shameless!

00:07:48.472 --> 00:07:50.424
What's the big idea?
What are you doing to me?

00:07:50.425 --> 00:07:52.265
Stay the night.

00:07:53.112 --> 00:07:54.511
Let us clean that head of yours

00:07:54.512 --> 00:07:55.792
and fix your attitude.

00:08:02.272 --> 00:08:03.231
Excuse us

00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:04.792
if things get a bit harsh.

00:08:07.137 --> 00:08:08.424
Enough.

00:08:08.425 --> 00:08:09.464
I don't want a dead man.

00:08:09.465 --> 00:08:11.105
He'll frighten my fish.

00:08:21.762 --> 00:08:23.031
What's the matter?

00:08:23.032 --> 00:08:25.512
Have you lost your voice already?

00:08:29.337 --> 00:08:31.896
What have you turned into?

00:08:31.897 --> 00:08:33.249
Turned into?

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.890
You clearly got the wrong idea about me.

00:08:36.832 --> 00:08:39.299
I was never a good person.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.545
Take a good look.

00:08:44.672 --> 00:08:46.432
This is who I am.

00:08:49.137 --> 00:08:50.337
I don't believe you.

00:08:50.872 --> 00:08:52.392
This isn't who you are.

00:08:52.592 --> 00:08:55.072
You're only doing this
because you resent me.

00:08:55.592 --> 00:08:56.712
Liang Yi,

00:08:57.512 --> 00:08:59.592
you give yourself too much credit.

00:09:01.872 --> 00:09:03.751
Although, I suppose

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.392
I should thank you.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:06.912
If it weren't for you,

00:09:07.272 --> 00:09:10.152
I wouldn't have reunited with a father
who has this much power.

00:09:10.792 --> 00:09:12.712
I should have returned to him long ago

00:09:13.192 --> 00:09:15.072
and made full use of my talents.

00:09:22.592 --> 00:09:24.712
Who do you think you are?

00:09:25.832 --> 00:09:27.192
What gives you the right?

00:09:28.725 --> 00:09:30.405
What gives?

00:09:33.037 --> 00:09:36.037
Do not test my limits.

00:09:36.787 --> 00:09:38.227
Understand?

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:41.672
I can kill you anytime I want.

00:09:51.525 --> 00:09:54.282
(It's my fault.)

00:09:54.437 --> 00:09:57.745

who pushed him into the abyss.)

Isn't that the daughter
of the Liang family?

00:10:37.072 --> 00:10:38.992
No, it's Mrs. Lin.

00:10:40.152 --> 00:10:41.031
What?

00:10:41.032 --> 00:10:41.911
Have you not heard?

00:10:41.912 --> 00:10:43.671
She's the real Miss Liang,

00:10:43.672 --> 00:10:45.351
the wife of Song Zhichu.

00:10:45.352 --> 00:10:48.912
I can't tell what kind of show
those two families are putting on.

Boss, Miss Liang has gone
to the Song Residence.

00:11:30.592 --> 00:11:33.111
I, Zhichu's widow,
have come to keep vigil.

00:11:33.112 --> 00:11:35.431
The Liang family has been persecuted
by Chengyun Society,

00:11:35.432 --> 00:11:37.311
our property taken by force.

00:11:37.312 --> 00:11:40.511
I beg you to help me, Father.

00:11:40.512 --> 00:11:41.911
I, Zhichu's widow,

00:11:41.912 --> 00:11:45.312
beg you
to uphold justice for me, Father.

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:52.832

That girl has guts.

00:12:19.312 --> 00:12:21.672
She really came up
with a move that underhanded.

00:12:21.752 --> 00:12:22.952
Let me handle her.

00:12:23.472 --> 00:12:25.831
If she's so eager
to be a Song daughter-in-law,

00:12:25.832 --> 00:12:28.832
then let her join Zhichu
on the other side.

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:31.912
Yun,

00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:35.272
I trust that you won't go soft on her.

00:12:39.887 --> 00:12:43.561
(Righteous Spirit)

00:12:43.562 --> 00:12:46.532
(Memorial Tablet of Husband Song Zhichu,
offered by his widow Liang Yi)

00:12:51.392 --> 00:12:51.951
Let me go!

00:12:51.952 --> 00:12:52.951
Get lost.

00:12:52.952 --> 00:12:54.311
Mr. Lin,

00:12:54.312 --> 00:12:56.511
I was lawfully married to Song Zhichu.

00:12:56.512 --> 00:12:58.751
Is it wrong for me to keep vigil
for my own husband?

00:12:58.752 --> 00:13:00.831
Stop putting on an act.

00:13:00.832 --> 00:13:02.591
You think Song Ming will defend you?

00:13:02.592 --> 00:13:04.271
Of course, he won't.

00:13:04.272 --> 00:13:05.591
Even if he kills me,

00:13:05.592 --> 00:13:08.151
he can't silence the whole city.

00:13:08.152 --> 00:13:10.151
Everyone saw what just happened.

00:13:10.152 --> 00:13:12.360
He'll have you disappear
without a trace.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.880
And you'd be the one
to do it for him, wouldn't you?

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:14.991
Go on, then.

00:13:14.992 --> 00:13:16.751
Dispose of me without leaving a trace.

00:13:16.752 --> 00:13:18.951
You can do it right now.

00:13:18.952 --> 00:13:20.751
Just say I hanged myself in grief

00:13:20.752 --> 00:13:23.151
before my husband's tablet.

00:13:23.152 --> 00:13:24.711
Liang Yi,

00:13:24.712 --> 00:13:25.951
do you have a death wish?

00:13:25.952 --> 00:13:27.351
No, I want to live.

00:13:27.352 --> 00:13:29.391
But you won't have the Liang family

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:31.351
unless you step over my body.

00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:33.871
For the Liang family,
you'd betray me

00:13:33.872 --> 00:13:35.752
and sacrifice yourself.

00:13:36.392 --> 00:13:36.911
What would

00:13:36.912 --> 00:13:38.672
your father think
if he could see you now?

00:13:41.192 --> 00:13:43.351
If you want to survive,

00:13:43.352 --> 00:13:44.712
