00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:46.399
Who

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:48.799
He is gone

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:55.000
Officer Yang

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.399
Over there, he ran off

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.799
Who

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:05.599
How did he disappear

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:07.640
You go that way, I will go this way

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.319
I know all your secrets inside out

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.599
Do not try to bargain with me

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.120
The cabaret now

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.439
is all under my control

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:53.920
If you want to be the star

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.200
then stop pretending to be so pure in front of me

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.760
Your secrets

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.120
I know them all too well

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.920
I will give it serious thought

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.719
What is it

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:09.719
Why do you keep following me

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.080
Because your dad is the bureau chief

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.400
It is safer sticking with you

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:18.159
Look, what is this

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.520
This exorcising talisman is really special

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.000
Come on, let us go in and take a look

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:40.759
This person

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.360
must be a fanatical puppet lover

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.479
So many things crammed together like this

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:46.759
gives a really strange feeling

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.199
Those two little puppets just now

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.159
gave me a scare

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.759
This looks like the puppet we saw earlier

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:57.719
What are you doing here

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.560
I am very interested

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:03.439
in how the puppets are made up

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.360
so I came over to have a look

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.039
Yes

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.560
I am in the lumber business

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.879
All the wooden items here

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.879
including this puppet, really fascinate me

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.800
I want to see everything clearly

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.280
You two are really odd

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.800
Everyone else wants to hide when they see the puppet

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.479
but you actually want to look at it

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.360
These are all belongings of the dead

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:23.400
Be careful not to attract something unclean

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.800
Whose belongings

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.000
Wu Laoban

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.360
They say when Wu Laoban was alive

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.240
he attracted something unclean

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.599
and that is why the puppet killed him

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.159
This room

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.879
is off limits now

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.080
Sorry

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.000
We will leave right away

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.919
Sorry, so sorry, we disturbed you

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.800
This dance hall is hiding a lot of secrets

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.639
Everyone is a suspect

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.319
So tell me, next

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400
what should we do

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.800
We stick to the usual plan

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.960
We split up and sound them out

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.599
Whoever has no alibi

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.120
is more likely to be the killer

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.599
Before Old Wu died

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.319
I got off work at 6 sharp every day

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.680
Now I have to stay up till dawn

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.080
and I do not even get a break

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:15.680
On the day Wu Laoban had his accident

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.279
I rushed over from home on purpose

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.600
From that day on

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.800
I have been so tired my whole body aches

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.040
Right, right here

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.600
So what do you do after work

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:30.879
Of course I spend time with my wife

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.879
You young kids

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.720
how would you understand

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:36.759
I get mad every time I mention that day

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.120
What happened

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:40.680
That day Zhou Laoban called out by name

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.199
and told Wenqing to sing one more song

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.240
so my time to go on stage got delayed

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.519
I was really pissed

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.680
I could only wait and wait in the dressing room

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:49.279
I did not go onstage until almost eleven

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.759
Let me tell you, these days

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.720
to meet the deadline for that puppet show

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.519
I have been busy from morning till night

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.000
Apart from the outhouse

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.920
I have not even stepped out the door

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.279
Got it

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.160
He really does have an alibi

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.759
Wenqing and Rose also alibi each other

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:10.319
Same with Sun Laoban

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.079
I asked several waiters

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:14.319
they all said they saw Sun Laoban

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.160
leave a little after 6 the other day

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.800
So it seems these people

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.720
none of them looks like the killer

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:23.480
Officer Yang

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.959
Su Xiaojie

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.879
And you, Li Mujiang

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.959
you three hid yourselves really well

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.199
How could you come investigate without a word

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:35.720
Do you think my place does not matter at all

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.879
Go, go, go

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:39.639
Go

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.920
No need to see us out

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:42.680
No need to see us out, really

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:44.199
Welcome, please come in

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.759
What kind of person is that

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.519
We have not caught the killer

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.439
and getting kicked out is so embarrassing

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:54.560
We just started to get a lead

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.040
and we already blew our cover

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:57.199
I cannot help but suspect

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:59.199
this is exactly the killer trying to drive us off

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.399
The key thing is this suit is too small for me

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.399
I held in my stomach all day

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.240
It is way too tight

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:11.120
Why is there a spoon here

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.319
Yeah, this

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:15.279
When did a spoon end up here

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.600
What else did you take from the dance hall

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.160
I did not take anything else

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:20.600
Do not make me search you myself

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:23.000
In this spot

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.639
there is only an ashtray

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.959
Old Li, none of this stuff is worth money

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:28.800
Do not disgrace our police station

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.600
What are you talking about

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.560
Anything else

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.759
Nothing else this time

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.879
Really nothing

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:39.240
Then why is there still a bulge here

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.480
A clock

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:45.399
So what kind of person do you two take me for

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.000
You think I steal things to sell for money

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:48.240
I am learning from you two

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:50.879
This might be a clue to solve the case

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:51.680
Once the case is solved

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.759
I will definitely return it

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.800
Not bad, Old Li

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:55.800
After the case is wrapped up smoothly

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:56.839
I will ask my dad to approve

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.879
a personal bonus for you

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:01.079
Really, thank you so much

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.439
The cabaret belongs to Wu Laoban and Sun Laoban

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.319
If anything happens to Wu Laoban

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.639
then Sun Laoban is the biggest beneficiary

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:18.720
Sun Laoban is in such a hurry

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.000
to kick us out of the cabaret

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.720
it is like he is scared we will find something out

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:24.480
He is the most suspicious

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:26.720
There are only two days left

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.560
How is your case going

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:30.879
Mind your own business

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.399
I heard

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:35.079
you were thrown out

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:36.680
If you cannot solve the case

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.199
it is not too late to speak up now

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:39.639
For the sake of our being colleagues

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:41.199
I can find you a

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:42.480
job sweeping floors and guarding doors

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.279
What is wrong with you

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.560
Brother

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:49.120
The carpenter told me

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:50.759
that Sun Laoban hired a master

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.360
to perform rites on the puppet to drive out evil

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.399
Looks like

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.519
this time we have to get serious

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:02.519
Heaven is round and earth is square

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:03.839
Nine chapters of divine law

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.240
Now I set my brush to paper

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.600
ten thousand ghosts shall be subdued

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:10.439
Master please drive out the evil spirit in the puppet

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:12.399
and keep the cabaret safe

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:15.720
Turn spin it for me

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.800
You heard that clearly right

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:18.959
It is Wu Laoban's vengeful spirit

00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:21.560
There are no such things as souls in this world

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.040
That is all nonsense

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:24.399
Why is it you again

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.480
Go away go away

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.199
Do not disturb the master doing the ritual

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.839
This is a special order from the chief

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:30.800
an investigation warrant on Wu Laoban's death

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.279
We are going in to investigate to the end

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:40.080
On my side I say

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:49.600
I do not dare disobey Chief Su's order

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.279
but our cabaret

00:08:51.759 --> 00:08:53.080
still has to operate normally

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.200
Fine

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:56.480
We promise you

00:08:57.639 --> 00:08:59.559
we will not affect the normal business of your cabaret

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.919
You must do as you say

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:01.879
Also

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.639
you must not reveal your identities

00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:06.559
I am afraid it will cause the guests to panic

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.000
No problem

00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:10.639
What are you doing

00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:13.399
I am saying this puppet is really strange

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.240
It has no mechanism nothing at all

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:15.919
Where is this sound coming from

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:16.639
Go away

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:17.759
Do not disturb the master doing the ritual

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.799
Go away

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.720
Alright alright

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.200
You go away too

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.120
There are still two days left

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.480
So what do we do next

00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:25.320
Watch Sun Laoban's every move

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:27.200
Everything else stays the same

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:29.120
This is all the boss's arrangement

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:30.440
You bitch

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.720
I will stop the bleeding for you

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.120
What is going on

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:51.759
Rose

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.480
What have you done to her again

00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:55.639
Prime time at eight tonight

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.799
it was supposed to be my turn to sing

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:57.600
why did it get changed again to

00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:58.679
that bitch Wenqing

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.919
Boss Zhou arranged it

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.919
there is nothing I can do either

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.679
Old Sun do not think I do not know

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.919
the cabaret is losing money now

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.840
you rely on me and Wenqing to bring in money

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.840
You want to promote her like Old Wu did

00:10:13.559 --> 00:10:15.039
Fine I will leave

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.120
Auntie auntie do not go do not go

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:19.440
Why are you leaving now

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:20.799
The show is about to start

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:22.720
Wenqing hurt her arm

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.879
and cannot perform again

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:25.559
Where are you going

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:27.679
The cabaret next door offered me a high price

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:30.480
If you will not keep me someone else will

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:32.000
Auntie

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:34.240
Eight tomorrow night

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.600
Eight the day after tomorrow

00:10:35.919 --> 00:10:37.840
You can sing both times alright

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:39.919
That is more like it

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.000
Wenqing passed out

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.080
Come help, quick

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:48.200
Wenqing

00:10:49.159 --> 00:10:50.360
Hurry, get her to the hospital

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.799
Hurry
