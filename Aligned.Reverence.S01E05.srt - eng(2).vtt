(Heaven Rewards Diligence)

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.780
Young Master Xie.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.860
I made a new set of clothes for you.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.540
The fabric is soft and gentle.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.220
Best for recovery and health.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.020
Come out and take it.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.539
Alright.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.380
You may leave it outside.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.860
What is wrong?

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.259
Nothing.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.820
I was applying medicine.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.219
Young Master Xie.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.460
Young Master Xie.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.820
Are you alright?

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.820
Let me help you.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.739
I can do it myself.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.660
It is fine.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.660
The dignified Sixth Young Master Xie,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.820
yet so badly injured,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.300
and still refusing help like this.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.780
Are you embarrassed, or afraid of pain?

00:02:47.937 --> 00:02:49.257
If you will not let me apply it,

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.340
I will tell Grandmother and Mother.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.780
They can come apply it for you.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.220
No, wait.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.700
Fine.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.250
If it hurts,

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.540
call out.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.660
There is no shame in it.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.545
I have yet to ask you,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.157
your injury,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.380
has it healed?

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.980
I am fine.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.500
It no longer troubles me.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.660
Here.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.260
You must not do this anymore.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.260
Always enduring injuries in silence,

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.980
holding back the pain,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.100
and saying it does not hurt.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.860
But you,

00:04:23.512 --> 00:04:25.220
are you not the same?

00:04:31.862 --> 00:04:34.662
I lost my parents at a young age.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.899
I have eaten enough bitterness.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.460
So pain no longer feels like pain.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.620
That was before
my elder brother and I appeared.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.860
From now on, I will protect you.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.995
It is I who has failed the Xiao family.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.620
I am unworthy of such kindness.

00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:01.285
I only wish...

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.180
Enough.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.260
Let me help you.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.220
I can manage on my own.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.260
I have put it away for you.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.940
Su Jinyuan.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.740
I know you struggle to forgive yourself.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.700
But to me,

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.740
you are the one most worthy.

00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:53.215
Thank you,

00:05:53.437 --> 00:05:54.357
Xie Yunyan.

00:06:18.037 --> 00:06:19.877
The bougainvilleas
are blooming beautifully.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.860
Look.

00:06:22.262 --> 00:06:22.899
Yes.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.140
Grand Madam, Madam.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.060
What is the matter?

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.860
The General and the Young General

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.980
have fallen in battle for the nation.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.700
Impossible.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.820
Impossible.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.580
Impossible!

(Memorial Tablet of Xiao Jin)

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.420
Sixth son of the Xiao family,
Xie Yunyan,

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.910
brings father and brother home.

00:08:09.975 --> 00:08:13.005
(Xiao Manor)

00:08:20.887 --> 00:08:22.782
(Memorial Tablet of Xiao Jin)

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.020
Jin.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.540
Yunxi.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.420
Yunxin.

00:08:35.287 --> 00:08:36.607
You are home.

00:08:37.525 --> 00:08:39.074
Home at last.

00:08:39.075 --> 00:08:40.619
(Xiao Manor)

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.270
Their spirits have not yet dispersed.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.345
Their remains return home.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.899
Welcome the General
and the Young General

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.470
back to the manor!

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.379
The garrison received a secret order.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.539
It is suspected that the Xiao father
and son may have faked their deaths.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.379
We are ordered to investigate.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.980
Open the coffins for examination.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.179
Today is the day

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.145
our departed return home.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.619
His Majesty granted this.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.740
The order you follow,

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.539
from whom does it come?

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.699
The Xiao father and son
died without cause.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.620
You hinder us at every step.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.059
Clearly something is amiss

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.460
within these coffins.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.699
Open them.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.520
Yes.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.540
If you wish to open them,

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.620
you must step over my body first.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.220
Any who obstruct

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.980
shall be killed without mercy.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.299
The case of Linchuan remains unsettled.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.499
Sir Luo, do you intend to exterminate
the Xiao family on your own authority?

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.540
Stand aside.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.940
Xie Yunyan.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.740
Open the coffin.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.339
You wretched dog.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.500
Do you truly think
the Xiao family has no one left?

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:45.120
(To the General of the Northern Cavalry.
A matter of utmost secrecy.)

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.220
(They forged a secret letter
accusing the Xiao family of treason.)

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.860
The coffin opening is but a pretense.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.060
To frame the Xiao family is the truth.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.870
Even if it costs my life today,

00:10:57.975 --> 00:10:59.335
I will kill you.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.299
Xie Yunyan.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.259
Let go.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.620
He is not worth it.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.980
Would you risk your life again

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.420
for a villain,
and let the Xiao family lose you too?

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.220
Then I will ask His Majesty myself.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.980
In this world,

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.260
where lies justice?

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:36.632
(Zichen Gate)

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.099
The Xiao family
suffers unjust accusations.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.460
Their loyal spirits cannot rest.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.620
We swear to clear our name.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.580
Let heaven and earth bear witness.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.300
I will stand with you.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.260
One strike of the grievance drum

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.660
means one must
shed blood to seek justice.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.500
Are you certain?

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.374
The Xiao family suffers
unjust accusations.

00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:53.895
Their loyal spirits cannot rest.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.180
We swear to clear our name.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.940
