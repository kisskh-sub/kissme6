WEBVTT

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:06.578
-Ready, set, go!
-Gentle-hearted gay man Genichi Hatano

00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:08.513
and his partner Saku Sakuta

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.082
begin searching for a home
to serve as a "clamp".

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:13.718
I want to make guitars.

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:16.721
Hotaru finally discovers
something she truly loves.

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:19.924
The trio’s "Parent-Child Contract"
continues.

00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:21.259
-But then,
-It's a tortoise.

00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:23.094
-Genichi’s pet tortoise escapes,
-Mr. Hatano?

00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:24.996
and when he reports it to the police,

00:00:25.563 --> 00:00:28.032
things start to take a sketchy turn.

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:32.537
Genichi then ends up
being taken in by the police.

00:00:33.138 --> 00:00:34.305
SUGINAMI CENTRAL POLICE

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.044
This way.

00:00:44.382 --> 00:00:46.417
First time in a police car?

00:00:46.484 --> 00:00:47.452
Yes.

00:00:48.186 --> 00:00:50.555
I figured getting you here fast
would be best.

00:00:51.923 --> 00:00:53.858
I didn’t expect to come in a police car.

00:00:54.692 --> 00:00:57.762
The little tortoise looked miserable.

00:00:58.396 --> 00:01:00.064
I’m just glad you found it.

00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:01.533
-This is ridiculous.
-Huh?

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:04.702
Picking someone up in a police car?
That just isn't right.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.438
-Figured.
-Come on. You were out on patrol anyway.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.141
We’ll get in trouble for this.

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:13.178
-Oh, and speaking of which, Mr. Hatano…
-What?

00:01:13.244 --> 00:01:16.648
You wrote your stage name
on the lost tortoise report, right?

00:01:16.714 --> 00:01:18.650
That’ll get you in trouble!

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:22.120
Oh, I didn’t even realize.
I usually write my real name,

00:01:22.187 --> 00:01:24.122
not my stage name.

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:25.256
What stage name?

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.159
Mr. Hatano here used to aim
to become a musician

00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:30.295
and still goes by that stage name,

00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:33.965
which is Genichi Hatano.
His real name is Mr. Jin Ichigaya.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.169
-Ah, you’ve got your ID, right?
-Huh?

00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:40.238
You’ll need it when picking up
your tortoise.

00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:42.774
I can do the explanation
about your stage name.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.611
Oh, no. I know you’re busy, Ms. Matsu.
Really, I'm fine by myself.

00:01:46.678 --> 00:01:48.880
Ah, no worries.
It'll be quick anyway. This way.

00:01:48.947 --> 00:01:53.318
No, no, no. I can do this myself, really.
Thank you. Sorry for the trouble.

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:54.619
What?

00:01:54.686 --> 00:01:57.355
I thought he was busted.
Him pretending to be my parent and all.

00:01:57.422 --> 00:01:59.224
He just went to pick up his tortoise.

00:01:59.824 --> 00:02:02.227
We won't be arrested if caught, right?

00:02:04.362 --> 00:02:07.031
"Could be charged
with violation of Child Welfare Act,

00:02:07.098 --> 00:02:09.801
youth protection law,
local development ordinance,

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:12.537
or Minor Offenses Act."

00:02:12.604 --> 00:02:15.773
So, we may become serious criminals?

00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:20.078
-Did you manage to pick it up properly?
-Yes.

00:02:20.144 --> 00:02:22.380
Thank you. I'll be leaving now.

00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:27.051
The person with the tortoise earlier…

00:02:27.118 --> 00:02:29.254
Ah, yes. Mr. Genichi Hatano.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.189
Was the ID name the same?

00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:33.324
-His ID.
-Yes.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.931
I'm back.

00:02:39.998 --> 00:02:41.833
Good thing you found it.

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:43.301
It might not be, actually.

00:02:43.368 --> 00:02:44.202
Why?

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.770
Well…

00:02:45.837 --> 00:02:47.538
Ms. Matsu might’ve figured something out.

00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:50.875
It's fine. If they find out,
I’ll explain everything.

00:02:50.942 --> 00:02:53.611
I’ll beg them to not arrest you,
Mr. Hatano.

00:02:53.678 --> 00:02:54.846
I'll get arrested?

00:02:54.912 --> 00:02:57.849
I’ll appeal to them too
that you're not a criminal.

00:02:57.915 --> 00:02:58.883
I'm a criminal?

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.885
I’m your accomplice anyway.

00:03:00.952 --> 00:03:02.887
-Sakuta…
-Yes?

00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:04.756
Let's break up.

00:03:06.124 --> 00:03:06.958
Huh?

00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:08.693
Because you're a teacher.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.828
And Hotaru,
you can just blame it all on me.

00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:12.330
-No!
-Are you stupid?

00:03:12.397 --> 00:03:15.166
-That's mean.
-Which of us is being mean here?

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:18.102
Say "let’s break up" one more time,
and we're done for good.

00:03:19.237 --> 00:03:20.571
No. I don't want that.

00:03:20.638 --> 00:03:23.308
Then I don't want to hear that
from you ever again.

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:25.977
Okay. I'm sorry.

00:03:37.255 --> 00:03:39.924
You’re terrible at staking out,
you know, Ms. Matsu?

00:03:39.991 --> 00:03:40.992
You're in the open.

00:03:41.826 --> 00:03:44.095
-Ms. Inokashira.
-Yes?

00:03:44.162 --> 00:03:45.430
Were you aware of it?

00:03:45.496 --> 00:03:46.664
About what?

00:03:46.731 --> 00:03:48.066
Genichi Hatano…

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.135
He isn’t Hotaru Kusunoki’s father, is he?

00:03:57.308 --> 00:04:01.179
Lying or hiding information
can lead to charges, just so you know.

00:04:01.245 --> 00:04:02.080
Okay.

00:04:02.146 --> 00:04:05.183
Were you pretending
to be Hotaru’s guardian too?

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:06.084
Not at all.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.119
You and Mr. Sakuta turned a blind eye

00:04:08.186 --> 00:04:11.255
to the fact that Mr. Hatano
was acting as her parent, right?

00:04:11.856 --> 00:04:12.990
Yes.

00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:16.294
-Did Hotaru give you anything in return?
-No.

00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:18.262
Are you in contact with her mom?

00:04:19.397 --> 00:04:20.231
Yes and no.

00:04:23.868 --> 00:04:26.371
Do you know
where the embezzled money went?

00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:27.905
Yes and no.

00:04:29.374 --> 00:04:31.509
Well, if you’re hiding money for her,

00:04:31.576 --> 00:04:33.845
that’s definitely a crime.

00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:35.012
About Hotaru,

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:38.349
is there any chance Mr. Hatano
is abusing or threatening her?

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.684
Not at all.

00:04:40.251 --> 00:04:41.552
How can you be so sure?

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:43.454
You can tell just by watching them.

00:04:43.521 --> 00:04:44.922
But sometimes you can’t, right?

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.925
But first, you’ve got
to actually observe, right?

00:04:47.992 --> 00:04:50.695
For example, their eyes can sometimes look

00:04:50.762 --> 00:04:52.463
almond-shaped or perfectly round.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.733
Or you may notice that the insides
of their ears and noses are a cute pink.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.668
Even the unexpected things

00:04:57.735 --> 00:04:59.604
become clear if you really pay attention.

00:05:00.872 --> 00:05:02.039
What are you talking about?

00:05:05.276 --> 00:05:06.511
It’s about goats.

00:05:06.577 --> 00:05:07.578
Why goats?

00:05:07.645 --> 00:05:10.014
Oh, right!

00:05:10.515 --> 00:05:11.849
Want this? I’ll lend it to you.

00:05:15.586 --> 00:05:17.989
Do you think Hatano will get arrested?

00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:19.023
Hard to say.

00:05:20.558 --> 00:05:22.427
Keep today’s discussion between us.

00:05:22.493 --> 00:05:24.362
For legal reasons, you know.

00:05:25.329 --> 00:05:26.164
Yes and no.

00:05:27.698 --> 00:05:29.033
You told her everything?

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.936
Her pressure was insane. What could I do?

00:05:32.003 --> 00:05:33.638
The police really are something.

00:05:33.704 --> 00:05:35.039
Even about my mom?

00:05:35.106 --> 00:05:36.908
I told her "yes and no" for that.

00:05:37.475 --> 00:05:38.309
What?

00:05:38.376 --> 00:05:41.979
I gave an ambiguous answer
to skate things around.

00:05:42.947 --> 00:05:45.416
Don’t let Hatano know about this.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.619
If he finds out, he’ll probably
do something unnecessary.

00:05:48.686 --> 00:05:51.422
Leave Ms. Matsu to me, then.

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:52.557
What do you mean?

00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:55.359
Aren't you excited?

00:05:55.426 --> 00:05:56.727
You mean, for Christmas?

00:05:56.794 --> 00:05:57.662
For the reserved cake.

00:05:57.728 --> 00:06:00.097
Ah, right. I need to pick it up.

00:06:00.164 --> 00:06:01.466
Yeah.

00:06:06.871 --> 00:06:07.738
How is it?

00:06:08.706 --> 00:06:09.907
What are you doing here?

00:06:09.974 --> 00:06:12.577
-I’m assisting the investigation.
-No, thanks.

00:06:12.643 --> 00:06:15.947
-I’ll just talk to them directly.
-Wait!

00:06:16.013 --> 00:06:17.615
Observe properly first.

00:06:17.682 --> 00:06:19.317
If you do, you’ll understand.

00:06:19.383 --> 00:06:20.284
Trust me.

00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:25.690
What are they to each other?

00:06:25.756 --> 00:06:27.558
Isn’t it obvious from what you see?

00:06:28.326 --> 00:06:31.295
-Partners in crime?
-You should go with just what you see.

00:06:32.797 --> 00:06:33.831
MILK

00:06:33.898 --> 00:06:36.200
He grabbed the milk from the front

00:06:36.701 --> 00:06:38.336
and put it in the basket.

00:06:38.402 --> 00:06:41.339
Would a bad person
really take milk from the front?

00:06:53.518 --> 00:06:56.621
I hope Koito and his partner made up.

00:06:56.687 --> 00:06:58.189
I’m sure they did!

00:06:58.256 --> 00:06:59.657
Aren’t you standing really close?

00:06:59.724 --> 00:07:01.392
We’re partners, remember?

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:03.494
Well, yeah.

00:07:04.295 --> 00:07:07.331
We should think about
that kind of stuff too, you know.

00:07:07.398 --> 00:07:08.232
What?

00:07:08.299 --> 00:07:10.201
About what to put in a notarized contract.

00:07:10.268 --> 00:07:13.771
Things like property,
or what happens if we get sick…

00:07:13.838 --> 00:07:16.741
Let's leave that to the professionals.

00:07:16.807 --> 00:07:20.011
More like how Koito and his partner
have their "hard-boiled egg" rule.

00:07:20.077 --> 00:07:22.880
For example, "always drink milk
in the morning"?

00:07:22.947 --> 00:07:24.282
I drink coffee.

00:07:24.348 --> 00:07:25.316
Noted.

00:07:26.217 --> 00:07:28.619
Why don’t we try doing a simulation?

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.221
A simulation?

00:07:32.456 --> 00:07:34.892
Nice!

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:36.093
What's your verdict?

00:07:36.661 --> 00:07:37.495
They’re…

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:39.597
building something?

00:07:40.665 --> 00:07:42.466
What are you doing?

00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:43.367
Yes?

00:07:43.434 --> 00:07:44.802
You were staring…

00:07:45.536 --> 00:07:46.704
at the kids. Am I wrong?

00:07:46.771 --> 00:07:49.206
I’m with the police. My name is Matsu.

00:07:49.974 --> 00:07:51.375
I’m the landlady, Inokashira.

00:07:51.442 --> 00:07:55.212
Oh? From that apartment
where I had the roasted sweet potatoes?

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:57.848
-Thank you for coming.
-Don't mention it.

00:07:57.915 --> 00:08:00.051
Why are you with the police, landlady?

00:08:00.117 --> 00:08:01.752
You are…?

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:06.090
I’m with an organization called Nikomado.
My name is Koito.

00:08:06.157 --> 00:08:07.158
I see.

00:08:07.892 --> 00:08:09.427
-And you know those kids?
-Yeah.

00:08:10.328 --> 00:08:11.796
They’re always around.

00:08:11.862 --> 00:08:14.599
-Thank you for looking after her.
-Don't mention it.

00:08:14.665 --> 00:08:17.101
They’re… handcrafting something.

00:08:17.168 --> 00:08:18.803
Not what you expected?

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:21.739
People call them "Toyoko Kids",

00:08:22.239 --> 00:08:25.343
but of course, there’s no one
actually by that name.

00:08:25.409 --> 00:08:29.013
Even if they’re in the same place,
they’re all different kids.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:33.017
Naturally, there are also kids
who are just having fun.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.123
I’m heading back for now.

00:08:41.392 --> 00:08:42.226
‎If you'd excuse me.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.961
See you.

00:08:46.597 --> 00:08:48.933
RESERVATION SLIP

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.268
Have you made any reservations recently?

00:08:51.335 --> 00:08:53.938
Recently… No.

00:08:54.005 --> 00:08:56.674
-Why not?
-There’s just been too much going on.

00:08:57.642 --> 00:08:58.676
Sorry about this.

00:08:58.743 --> 00:08:59.610
TOOTHPASTE

00:08:59.677 --> 00:09:02.246
Okay then,
for drafting the notarized contract,

00:09:02.313 --> 00:09:06.250
we’ll start the joint-living simulation.
I appreciate the cooperation.

00:09:06.317 --> 00:09:07.184
No problem.

00:09:08.252 --> 00:09:10.087
Um, what should we do?

00:09:10.154 --> 00:09:11.322
Shall we cook a meal?

00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:13.591
Yeah. Then…

00:09:13.658 --> 00:09:14.692
-Curry!
-How about stew?

00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:28.406
KOKUUMA CREAM STEW, KOKUUMA CURRY

00:09:38.482 --> 00:09:39.517
You're fine with stew?

00:09:39.583 --> 00:09:42.086
I’m older, so I’ll yield to you.

00:09:48.259 --> 00:09:49.126
Huh?

00:09:49.193 --> 00:09:50.928
Hey!

00:09:50.995 --> 00:09:53.464
Stop worrying about your age!

00:09:53.531 --> 00:09:54.565
I'm sorry.

00:09:55.232 --> 00:09:56.167
Good.

00:09:57.768 --> 00:10:00.805
We can write "no worrying about age"
on the notarized contract.

00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:02.773
There's no need to write that!

00:10:03.641 --> 00:10:04.508
I'm sorry.

00:10:05.076 --> 00:10:06.177
Good.

00:10:06.944 --> 00:10:09.480
What dish is this, exactly?
Does it have a name?

00:10:09.547 --> 00:10:11.716
Curry Cream Stew? Cream Stew Curry?

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:16.954
-Let's dig in.
-Yeah.

00:10:23.994 --> 00:10:25.062
It's delicious!

00:10:36.807 --> 00:10:39.076
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:10:39.143 --> 00:10:40.778
-Sorry for doing this without asking…
-Not at all.

00:10:40.845 --> 00:10:42.646
I toasted some bread. Want some?

00:10:42.713 --> 00:10:44.248
Yeah, sure.

00:10:56.827 --> 00:10:59.196
-You drink milk, right?
-Ah, yes.

00:11:01.298 --> 00:11:02.666
-Wait.
-Huh?

00:11:03.167 --> 00:11:04.969
How about a café au lait?

00:11:05.035 --> 00:11:06.270
Sounds good.

00:11:06.771 --> 00:11:08.706
MILK

00:11:20.851 --> 00:11:23.988
Today, let’s try simulating
an actual budget for buying a house

00:11:24.054 --> 00:11:25.856
and see what we get.

00:11:25.923 --> 00:11:28.392
Based on that,
I'll find you appropriate properties.

00:11:28.459 --> 00:11:29.426
Okay.

00:11:30.094 --> 00:11:32.596
We’re actually doing
a simulation right now too.

00:11:32.663 --> 00:11:34.331
-What simulation?
-Our cohabitation life.

00:11:34.398 --> 00:11:36.267
Wow, you two are so lovey-dovey!

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:38.035
I’m really happy for you!

00:11:38.102 --> 00:11:39.470
I feel like I might cry.

00:11:39.537 --> 00:11:41.372
You're being over the top.

00:11:41.438 --> 00:11:43.340
Well, we're lovey-dovey, though.

00:11:46.243 --> 00:11:49.647
Um, could we start the budget simulation?

00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:51.615
Sorry.

00:11:52.483 --> 00:11:54.118
First, you two want a joint loan, yes?

00:11:54.185 --> 00:11:56.587
That's right. We want it
in both our names,

00:11:56.654 --> 00:11:58.889
so we’re both responsible.

00:11:58.956 --> 00:12:01.826
We want to split it evenly too,
and each own the house 50/50.

00:12:01.892 --> 00:12:05.396
Very well. Then let’s start
with your annual income.

00:12:06.463 --> 00:12:09.066
-About 4.5 million.
-6.5 million yen.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.402
What, really?

00:12:11.468 --> 00:12:13.504
I think that's about right.

00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:14.572
Ah…

00:12:15.573 --> 00:12:17.741
I feel kind of pathetic, you know?

00:12:18.576 --> 00:12:22.513
Judging someone by how much money
they make is so outdated.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.981
I'm sorry.

00:12:24.048 --> 00:12:27.585
We can write "no grudges over money"
in the notarized contract.

00:12:27.651 --> 00:12:29.386
-There's no need for that.
-Okay.

00:12:29.453 --> 00:12:32.189
By the way, for the loan period,

00:12:32.256 --> 00:12:33.958
the maximum age is 80.

00:12:34.024 --> 00:12:37.094
Based on Genichi’s age,
we could manage at most…

00:12:37.161 --> 00:12:38.529
30 years.

00:12:40.898 --> 00:12:42.600
It's all because I'm so old…

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.102
Stop worrying about your age!

00:12:45.169 --> 00:12:47.771
We should write this
in the notarized contract aft--

00:12:47.838 --> 00:12:49.506
-I said no!
-Okay.

00:12:50.507 --> 00:12:52.209
-Sorry.
-No worries.

00:12:52.877 --> 00:12:56.080
Alright, what about monthly repayments?

00:12:56.146 --> 00:12:58.215
Would around 150,000 yen be the limit?

00:12:58.816 --> 00:13:01.185
That’s 75,000 yen each.

00:13:01.252 --> 00:13:04.688
Based on that, a rough estimate
of the maximum loan amount

00:13:04.755 --> 00:13:06.423
is 51 million yen.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.259
How much are you thinking
for down payment?

00:13:08.325 --> 00:13:11.028
About two million each,
as we discussed the other day.

00:13:11.095 --> 00:13:14.698
-Yes.
-So, that adds up to 55 million yen.

00:13:15.432 --> 00:13:17.635
Properties around this range
would be appropriate.

00:13:18.302 --> 00:13:20.371
-Fifty-five million yen, huh…
-Give me a moment.

00:13:21.472 --> 00:13:24.508
Recommendations within your budget…

00:13:25.142 --> 00:13:26.010
Here are a few.

00:13:26.076 --> 00:13:27.678
Let's see…

00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:29.246
What do you think?

00:13:30.915 --> 00:13:32.416
Let's try putting
the budget aside for a bit

00:13:32.483 --> 00:13:35.386
and start with the conditions first.

00:13:35.452 --> 00:13:36.820
Sure, no problem.

00:13:37.421 --> 00:13:40.424
-Start with the area you want to live in.
-Within the 23 wards of Tokyo?

00:13:40.491 --> 00:13:43.460
I’d like it to be close to work,
so this area would be good.

00:13:43.527 --> 00:13:44.461
What about size?

00:13:44.528 --> 00:13:46.130
Around 60 square meters is ideal.

00:13:46.196 --> 00:13:49.366
The dogs will be with us too,
and we’d like separate rooms.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.137
Sixty square meters, 2LDK,

00:13:53.203 --> 00:13:54.371
and pet-friendly.

00:13:54.438 --> 00:13:57.474
And within a 15-minute walk
from the station.

00:13:57.541 --> 00:13:59.510
I’d like the place
to be less than ten years old.

00:13:59.576 --> 00:14:00.444
Oh, and a parking lot.

00:14:00.511 --> 00:14:01.679
Got it.

00:14:01.745 --> 00:14:04.782
And, if possible, one more room.

00:14:05.983 --> 00:14:07.284
Right.

00:14:07.351 --> 00:14:09.086
Understood.

00:14:09.153 --> 00:14:10.387
Please give me a moment.

00:14:13.023 --> 00:14:15.225
Have a look.

00:14:15.292 --> 00:14:17.194
-Let's see…
-Take your time.

00:14:18.762 --> 00:14:20.030
75,800,000 YEN

00:14:20.097 --> 00:14:21.298
So expensive.

00:14:21.365 --> 00:14:22.366
80,800,000 YEN

00:14:25.669 --> 00:14:27.805
You guys need to be realistic.

00:14:27.871 --> 00:14:29.873
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

00:14:30.441 --> 00:14:32.276
This is today's breakfast.

00:14:32.776 --> 00:14:34.144
Thank you.

00:14:34.211 --> 00:14:37.014
Sakuta has been making it lately.

00:14:37.081 --> 00:14:39.950
-Good morning.
-Why are you here again?

00:14:40.017 --> 00:14:42.152
I might have a talent for tailing people.

00:14:42.219 --> 00:14:43.253
What?

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.356
Never mind that. Just observe carefully.

00:14:46.023 --> 00:14:48.726
-Don't tell him, okay?
-So, you prefer dried sardine rice ball?

00:14:49.226 --> 00:14:51.795
-See you.
-See you.

00:14:56.967 --> 00:14:58.168
Okay, let's go.

00:14:58.969 --> 00:15:01.505
So, how was it? Do you get it now
after observing thoroughly?

00:15:02.906 --> 00:15:04.475
Picking the milk in front…

00:15:05.676 --> 00:15:06.844
Having fun…

00:15:07.578 --> 00:15:08.879
Seeing her off…

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:10.681
It was all normal.

00:15:11.248 --> 00:15:12.883
-See?
-But I don't get it.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.785
-Huh?
-You know,

00:15:14.852 --> 00:15:17.721
I think sometimes just observing
isn’t enough to understand.

00:15:18.789 --> 00:15:22.659
Well, thank you for your cooperation
in the investigation. If you'd excuse me.

00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:29.733
After deducting handling fees,

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.136
that comes to 123,000 yen.

00:15:32.202 --> 00:15:34.738
If you’re fine with that, please sign

00:15:34.805 --> 00:15:36.106
and seal here.

00:15:38.308 --> 00:15:39.476
Mr. Ichigaya?

00:15:40.077 --> 00:15:41.245
Yes?

00:15:41.311 --> 00:15:43.814
I'll do it, yeah!

00:15:44.314 --> 00:15:47.484
JIN ICHIGAYA

00:15:47.551 --> 00:15:49.386
I didn’t have a choice.

00:15:49.453 --> 00:15:50.921
I didn’t want to sell it either,

00:15:50.988 --> 00:15:53.524
but supporting this little guy
isn’t cheap.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.061
So, you’re looking for a new place
to start fresh?

00:15:57.127 --> 00:16:00.330
Somewhere cheap where I can live
with him. Somewhere decent.

00:16:00.898 --> 00:16:01.899
In that case,

00:16:01.965 --> 00:16:03.767
the one I showed you before

00:16:03.834 --> 00:16:05.569
is the only place I can recommend.

00:16:05.636 --> 00:16:07.404
I don’t want to live in such a place.

00:16:07.471 --> 00:16:08.605
Is that so?

00:16:10.107 --> 00:16:11.542
For now…

00:16:12.142 --> 00:16:13.243
I guess I can check it out.

00:16:14.011 --> 00:16:14.845
Understood.

00:16:16.547 --> 00:16:18.449
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS VIEWING
FOR MR. ICHIGAYA

00:16:18.515 --> 00:16:19.349
FOR THURSDAY THE 25TH

00:16:19.416 --> 00:16:22.453
I wonder if there’s a school
that teaches how to make guitars.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.721
What made you want to make guitars?

00:16:26.256 --> 00:16:27.291
I don't know.

00:16:28.392 --> 00:16:29.526
Right.

00:16:30.961 --> 00:16:33.130
So, I thought, maybe I’ll try making one.

00:16:33.197 --> 00:16:35.365
That sounds fun.

00:16:36.733 --> 00:16:39.403
Not that I’m gonna show anyone,
even if it’s finished.

00:16:40.504 --> 00:16:42.606
What, not even to Hatano?

00:16:43.173 --> 00:16:44.007
Nope.

00:16:44.074 --> 00:16:45.342
He'd cry. I'm telling you!

00:16:49.079 --> 00:16:51.949
I’ll do some research on my end too.

00:16:52.549 --> 00:16:54.384
Thank you.

00:16:59.756 --> 00:17:00.624
Mr. Sakuta.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.564
So, there’s no doubt
you helped Mr. Hatano?

00:17:08.832 --> 00:17:09.733
Yes.

00:17:10.667 --> 00:17:11.535
Why did you?

00:17:12.836 --> 00:17:14.538
I wonder why myself.

00:17:14.605 --> 00:17:16.640
As a teacher, that’s already wrong.

00:17:17.774 --> 00:17:21.145
But what would the right thing
for a teacher to do be?

00:17:24.481 --> 00:17:25.749
Mr. Sakuta,

00:17:26.383 --> 00:17:28.318
why did you want to become a teacher?

00:17:32.556 --> 00:17:35.259
There was this science teacher
whose little stories were fun.

00:17:35.893 --> 00:17:38.128
The way he explained the concept of time…

00:17:38.195 --> 00:17:40.697
He said that the passage of time

00:17:40.764 --> 00:17:42.766
is like things mixing together.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.404
Like how coffee and milk mix
into café au lait.

00:17:47.471 --> 00:17:50.007
Once they mix, they don’t separate again.

00:17:50.073 --> 00:17:51.375
That’s what time is.

00:17:51.942 --> 00:17:54.645
Learning things
you don’t understand is fascinating.

00:17:55.312 --> 00:17:57.581
So, you looked up to that teacher
and decided to be one?

00:17:57.648 --> 00:17:58.849
I also thought…

00:17:59.516 --> 00:18:01.852
there should be a variety of teachers.

00:18:02.886 --> 00:18:03.854
What do you mean?

00:18:03.921 --> 00:18:05.622
Such as teachers who don't like school,

00:18:06.223 --> 00:18:08.358
teachers who aren't good at teaching,

00:18:08.959 --> 00:18:11.828
and teachers who feel uncomfortable
in the classroom.

00:18:12.629 --> 00:18:13.864
Even teachers who are gay.

00:18:17.334 --> 00:18:18.435
With Mr. Hatano…

00:18:19.102 --> 00:18:20.537
Are you dating him?

00:18:22.706 --> 00:18:25.175
I know you’ve been keeping an eye
on us the whole time.

00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:27.911
You’re not very good at stakeouts.

00:18:30.681 --> 00:18:33.383
But I think it’s okay
to have clumsy police officers too.

00:18:35.953 --> 00:18:39.289
I’ll report back
to the school another day.

00:18:41.725 --> 00:18:42.726
Okay.

00:18:42.793 --> 00:18:45.495
So, what did you think of the place
after checking it out?

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.533
It satisfies most of your criteria.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.168
I’m not sure anymore.

00:18:51.935 --> 00:18:54.204
-Huh?
-I’ve seen so many places

00:18:54.271 --> 00:18:57.608
that I’m forgetting
what really matters to me.

00:18:57.674 --> 00:19:00.711
What kind of home
do I actually want to live in?

00:19:01.678 --> 00:19:04.114
Why don't you try
a different perspective for once?

00:19:04.181 --> 00:19:05.215
What do you mean?

00:19:05.282 --> 00:19:07.417
Let’s see some properties

00:19:07.484 --> 00:19:10.020
that don’t match your criteria at all.

00:19:11.088 --> 00:19:12.689
Okay, let's do just that.

00:19:12.756 --> 00:19:13.590
Very well.

00:19:13.657 --> 00:19:14.758
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS VIEWING
FOR MS. MOMOSE

00:19:16.326 --> 00:19:17.494
Done!

00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:19.429
-We did it!
-Yay!

00:19:19.496 --> 00:19:22.065
-Yay!
-Yay!

00:19:22.132 --> 00:19:23.133
Well then,

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.468
-I'm going to play it.
-Okay.

00:19:26.336 --> 00:19:27.170
Wow!

00:19:27.237 --> 00:19:29.773
-You're amazing!
-It does produce sounds!

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.008
It's kinda funny.

00:19:32.843 --> 00:19:35.112
-This is a masterpiece.
-You're the best.

00:19:35.178 --> 00:19:37.114
Look over here, Hotaru!

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.215
It's kinda cool!

00:19:53.764 --> 00:19:54.731
Does Coffee catch your eye?

00:19:55.632 --> 00:19:57.701
-What?
-Ah, my bad.

00:19:57.768 --> 00:19:59.536
That’s the name of this guitar.

00:20:00.203 --> 00:20:02.739
Because it’s made
with the color of coffee,

00:20:02.806 --> 00:20:05.709
they call it Coffee.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.912
I didn't know guitars actually have names.

00:20:11.114 --> 00:20:12.516
This one’s called Cherry.

00:20:13.216 --> 00:20:14.951
It's made using cherry blossom wood.

00:20:15.552 --> 00:20:17.154
That over there is Maple.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.790
They're all made
by the same guitar workshop,

00:20:19.856 --> 00:20:24.027
but they give them these unique names.

00:20:26.296 --> 00:20:27.464
What about yours?

00:20:28.265 --> 00:20:29.299
What do you call it?

00:20:45.582 --> 00:20:49.886
Today my heart

00:20:50.487 --> 00:20:53.924
Tucked in the bottom of my bag

00:20:55.092 --> 00:20:55.992
Hid…

00:20:58.929 --> 00:21:00.230
-Um!
-Yes?

00:21:00.297 --> 00:21:01.264
There's something…

00:21:01.898 --> 00:21:03.834
What?

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.036
I noticed something during our simulation.

00:21:09.906 --> 00:21:10.974
Okay.

00:21:12.209 --> 00:21:13.343
Your singing.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.846
What, you hate music?

00:21:15.912 --> 00:21:17.714
No, I love it.

00:21:19.116 --> 00:21:21.151
And I guess because I do…

00:21:21.752 --> 00:21:25.622
I don’t mind listening
to your singing, Hatano.

00:21:26.189 --> 00:21:28.759
But anything else, it distracts me…

00:21:29.292 --> 00:21:31.194
No, that’s not quite right.

00:21:31.261 --> 00:21:34.097
It makes my feelings all over the place.

00:21:39.336 --> 00:21:40.737
Sorry.

00:21:41.304 --> 00:21:42.305
I'm happy to hear that.

00:21:42.873 --> 00:21:44.241
-Huh?
-Because you don’t

00:21:44.307 --> 00:21:46.710
really talk much about yourself.

00:21:46.777 --> 00:21:48.378
I'm just not good at it.

00:21:48.445 --> 00:21:49.346
So,

00:21:49.413 --> 00:21:53.183
living together and getting to know you

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.651
makes me really, really happy.

00:21:55.819 --> 00:21:57.687
So, when I want to sing,

00:21:57.754 --> 00:21:59.856
I’ll ask if it’s alright with you, okay?

00:22:00.791 --> 00:22:03.960
Are there certain times
you feel like singing?

00:22:04.027 --> 00:22:05.695
Yeah. All sorts of times.

00:22:05.762 --> 00:22:08.598
When I want to understand
my own feelings, I guess?

00:22:09.633 --> 00:22:11.401
What do you mean?

00:22:11.468 --> 00:22:14.771
I realized that back during my first love,
I used to write songs too.

00:22:15.372 --> 00:22:16.640
That’s how I knew I was in love!

00:22:17.307 --> 00:22:19.476
When you understand your own feelings,

00:22:20.043 --> 00:22:21.044
it puts you at ease.

00:22:25.715 --> 00:22:26.550
Welcome!

00:22:29.786 --> 00:22:31.655
You’re in luck!

00:22:32.222 --> 00:22:34.758
-Huh?
-We still have Christmas cakes.

00:22:34.825 --> 00:22:36.026
Well, uh…

00:22:36.092 --> 00:22:37.561
I'm sure your wife

00:22:37.627 --> 00:22:39.729
or kids would be pleased!

00:22:40.397 --> 00:22:43.200
Oh, that’s good. Lucky me, really.

00:22:43.266 --> 00:22:44.367
That's right…

00:22:44.868 --> 00:22:46.870
I also recommend this one.

00:22:46.937 --> 00:22:48.705
It even has floor heating.

00:22:49.906 --> 00:22:52.843
Will floor heating make me happy?

00:22:53.443 --> 00:22:54.411
To some extent.

00:22:55.779 --> 00:22:57.914
Warm floors do make life a little happier.

00:22:59.216 --> 00:23:00.617
I’ve just been feeling…

00:23:00.684 --> 00:23:03.420
unsettled lately.

00:23:03.487 --> 00:23:05.489
-Is that so?
-Even though I’m single…

00:23:05.555 --> 00:23:07.324
I went and bought a huge cake.

00:23:09.326 --> 00:23:11.161
You get to enjoy a whole cake on your own!

00:23:12.462 --> 00:23:15.065
Ah, sorry.
That’s probably not what you meant.

00:23:15.565 --> 00:23:18.735
How do I find my happiness?

00:23:20.003 --> 00:23:23.006
Tomorrow, I’m going to check out
an interesting property.

00:23:24.541 --> 00:23:26.943
You may find something
while looking at different places.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.945
Maybe even what you consider happiness.

00:23:29.946 --> 00:23:31.715
Then, I’ll leave it to you.

00:23:31.781 --> 00:23:32.616
Okay.

00:23:32.682 --> 00:23:34.618
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS VIEWING
FOR MR. YOSHIDA

00:23:34.684 --> 00:23:35.919
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

00:23:36.987 --> 00:23:38.255
Hello.

00:23:38.321 --> 00:23:39.923
Hello.

00:23:41.057 --> 00:23:43.360
-This is the apartment we'll be viewing.
-Right.

00:23:44.728 --> 00:23:46.129
Mr. Yoshida.

00:23:47.864 --> 00:23:49.599
-Mr. Yoshida is tagging along as well?
-Um…

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.368
-Is this the place?
-Yes.

00:23:51.434 --> 00:23:53.303
It's called Inokashira Apartments.

00:23:54.271 --> 00:23:56.806
This place might not be
the one for me. Sorry.

00:23:56.873 --> 00:23:57.941
Wait, why?

00:23:58.008 --> 00:23:59.042
-Ah!
-Uh…

00:23:59.109 --> 00:24:00.043
Everyone!

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.945
Welcome!

00:24:02.012 --> 00:24:03.813
This is the landlady, Ms. Inokashira.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.285
-This is Mr. Yoshida…
-Mr. Yoshida, nice to meet you.

00:24:08.351 --> 00:24:09.619
Likewise.

00:24:09.686 --> 00:24:12.188
I'm Momose. Nice to meet you.

00:24:12.255 --> 00:24:14.291
Ah, you're from the parfait place!

00:24:17.193 --> 00:24:18.862
Ah, you're from that day!

00:24:18.929 --> 00:24:20.697
Thank you for that day.

00:24:20.764 --> 00:24:22.232
-You know each other?
-Yes.

00:24:22.299 --> 00:24:23.266
I see.

00:24:23.333 --> 00:24:24.568
There's one more person.

00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:26.736
It's this person.

00:24:26.803 --> 00:24:28.672
You're from that day.

00:24:28.738 --> 00:24:30.206
Hello.

00:24:30.273 --> 00:24:32.475
So, you’ve decided to look after Hotaru?

00:24:32.542 --> 00:24:33.977
You know each other too?

00:24:34.044 --> 00:24:35.312
He's Kusunoki's dad.

00:24:35.378 --> 00:24:37.347
-What?
-Who's Kusunoki?

00:24:39.816 --> 00:24:40.650
You're from the stakeout!

00:24:40.717 --> 00:24:42.319
What stakeout? Why?

00:24:42.385 --> 00:24:44.087
-She's with the police.
-What?

00:24:44.154 --> 00:24:46.122
-Is there a case?
-Hello.

00:24:46.189 --> 00:24:47.190
Hello.

00:24:47.958 --> 00:24:49.626
I'm hoping we can properly speak today.

00:24:49.693 --> 00:24:51.695
Okay. Right this way, please.

00:24:53.363 --> 00:24:54.831
What?

00:24:54.898 --> 00:24:56.132
What case is this about?

00:24:56.199 --> 00:24:57.167
Stakeout?

00:24:57.233 --> 00:24:58.969
What do you mean by that?

00:25:05.709 --> 00:25:06.543
Coming!

00:25:08.144 --> 00:25:09.245
-Hello.
-Huh?

00:25:10.246 --> 00:25:12.082
-What's going on?
-Mr. Hatano?

00:25:12.148 --> 00:25:13.984
Genichi, did you do something?

00:25:14.551 --> 00:25:15.652
Genichi Hatano.

00:25:15.719 --> 00:25:17.754
I came by to hear what you have to say.

00:25:21.992 --> 00:25:24.294
And since you all appear
to know one another,

00:25:24.361 --> 00:25:26.630
would it be alright
if I spoke with you collectively?

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.603
I'm Matsu from Suginami Central Police,
Community Safety Division.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.238
For the past few days,

00:25:35.305 --> 00:25:37.574
I’ve been looking into Mr. Hatano

00:25:37.641 --> 00:25:39.476
and those around him.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.511
What?

00:25:41.578 --> 00:25:42.712
Ms. Inokashira

00:25:42.779 --> 00:25:45.015
and Mr. Sakuta,
I've already spoken to them.

00:25:45.081 --> 00:25:46.650
You knew about this?

00:25:48.018 --> 00:25:48.852
Yes.

00:26:06.436 --> 00:26:07.737
Mr. Hatano.

00:26:07.804 --> 00:26:10.573
You’re pretending
to be Hotaru Kusunoki’s dad,

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.541
is that right?

00:26:14.077 --> 00:26:17.480
-Yes.
-Kusunoki is only 15 years old, a minor.

00:26:18.081 --> 00:26:21.384
Since there could be a case involved,
we’ve been investigating.

00:26:22.318 --> 00:26:24.320
Now, starting from you.

00:26:24.387 --> 00:26:26.389
Please tell me about your relationship
with Mr. Hatano.

00:26:26.456 --> 00:26:28.792
My name is Okabe.

00:26:29.659 --> 00:26:31.227
I'm Genichi’s friend

00:26:31.861 --> 00:26:32.696
and a property agent.

00:26:34.264 --> 00:26:35.298
My name is Momose.

00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:38.802
Can I tell her about that?

00:26:39.502 --> 00:26:41.004
Well, yes.

00:26:42.338 --> 00:26:44.140
I'm a consultant at a partner agency.

00:26:44.708 --> 00:26:45.642
What's that?

00:26:45.709 --> 00:26:48.778
It's a marriage consultation agency
for gay people.

00:26:49.646 --> 00:26:50.613
I see.

00:26:54.217 --> 00:26:56.820
And you are?

00:26:56.886 --> 00:26:58.655
Please be honest.

00:27:00.223 --> 00:27:01.491
Is it okay to say it too?

00:27:02.425 --> 00:27:03.560
It's fine.

00:27:04.794 --> 00:27:06.062
If you're okay with it.

00:27:07.931 --> 00:27:09.099
My name is Yoshida.

00:27:09.833 --> 00:27:10.700
Uh…

00:27:11.201 --> 00:27:15.004
He's my ex-boyfriend,
and he's his current boyfriend.

00:27:15.071 --> 00:27:18.007
-Wait, what?
-Oh, I see how it is.

00:27:18.074 --> 00:27:19.075
A love triangle?

00:27:19.142 --> 00:27:20.510
Is that true?

00:27:20.577 --> 00:27:22.045
We've already broken up amicably.

00:27:22.112 --> 00:27:23.346
So,

00:27:23.413 --> 00:27:26.282
did you know about Mr. Hatano
and Kusunoki’s relationship?

00:27:28.084 --> 00:27:30.553
I've heard about it briefly.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.889
They're really not involved in this.

00:27:32.956 --> 00:27:34.491
Why did you do this?

00:27:34.557 --> 00:27:35.992
I asked him to.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.228
Really?

00:27:38.294 --> 00:27:39.662
He isn’t making you say this?

00:27:39.729 --> 00:27:41.097
I’m speaking for myself.

00:27:41.164 --> 00:27:43.066
Has he done anything you didn’t like?

00:27:43.133 --> 00:27:45.735
He made dinner for me without asking,

00:27:45.802 --> 00:27:47.837
helped me prepare for my test,

00:27:47.904 --> 00:27:50.507
and nagged about me being home late.

00:27:50.573 --> 00:27:51.608
I didn’t like those things.

00:27:52.842 --> 00:27:55.879
Even if it was purely for Hotaru’s sake,

00:27:55.945 --> 00:27:57.847
there were other ways to handle it, no?

00:27:57.914 --> 00:28:00.717
So, why did you go out of your way
to pretend to be her parent?

00:28:03.119 --> 00:28:04.888
Did you want to try raising a child?

00:28:08.958 --> 00:28:10.493
-Huh?
-Because the two of you…

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:11.961
can’t have one, yes?

00:28:12.028 --> 00:28:13.029
Ms. Matsu!

00:28:13.696 --> 00:28:15.632
I apologize if I come off as rude,

00:28:15.698 --> 00:28:17.267
but what’s the truth of it?

00:28:21.738 --> 00:28:24.040
I can’t say for sure that…

00:28:25.275 --> 00:28:26.509
that wasn’t the case.

00:28:28.011 --> 00:28:30.413
So, that was your intention, then?

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.448
-Is that a bad thing?
-What?

00:28:32.515 --> 00:28:34.784
It doesn’t matter
what Mr. Hatano’s motives were.

00:28:35.518 --> 00:28:37.620
I appreciated his help.

00:28:37.687 --> 00:28:38.788
I’m just glad about that.

00:28:38.855 --> 00:28:40.623
Maybe that’s true for now.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:43.860
No matter what happens from here on,
I’ll feel the same. I'm sure about it.

00:28:43.927 --> 00:28:45.495
You can’t really know that, can you?

00:28:45.562 --> 00:28:48.031
Uh, Genichi is just a meddling,

00:28:48.598 --> 00:28:51.034
music-loving old man.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.770
I agree! Saku

00:28:53.837 --> 00:28:55.738
has a good eye for men,

00:28:55.805 --> 00:28:58.374
and he’s with this person.

00:28:59.542 --> 00:29:00.443
What do you mean?

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.544
Um…

00:29:02.278 --> 00:29:03.379
Love and revolution!

00:29:04.013 --> 00:29:05.915
-Huh?
-I think why Mr. Hatano and the others

00:29:05.982 --> 00:29:06.916
acted as her parents

00:29:06.983 --> 00:29:10.153
was probably for love and revolution.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.721
What's that?

00:29:12.288 --> 00:29:15.792
I'm not sure how to explain it. Um…

00:29:17.193 --> 00:29:18.027
Love…

00:29:18.661 --> 00:29:19.996
is like finding someone

00:29:20.063 --> 00:29:21.664
or something you care about.

00:29:21.731 --> 00:29:23.299
And rebelling against people who try

00:29:23.366 --> 00:29:25.335
to push you around, or society in general,

00:29:25.401 --> 00:29:28.738
and then becoming free,

00:29:28.805 --> 00:29:30.607
living life the way you want.

00:29:31.875 --> 00:29:34.143
-I don't really get it.
-In any case,

00:29:34.844 --> 00:29:38.448
we live for love and revolution!

00:29:38.514 --> 00:29:39.582
What a cool thing to say!

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:43.119
Oh, no. Please stop.

00:29:43.186 --> 00:29:45.255
The one that's cool is Dazai.

00:29:46.022 --> 00:29:47.190
Love and revolution, huh?

00:29:48.324 --> 00:29:51.427
LOVE AND REVOLUTION

00:30:06.676 --> 00:30:09.212
Will Mr. Hatano be arrested?

00:30:09.812 --> 00:30:12.315
If what everyone here said is true,

00:30:12.982 --> 00:30:14.284
then probably no.

00:30:15.618 --> 00:30:17.887
He hasn’t done anything wrong
to you, Hotaru.

00:30:18.922 --> 00:30:19.956
Thank goodness…

00:30:20.023 --> 00:30:23.192
But he will be questioned voluntarily,

00:30:23.259 --> 00:30:25.595
and, of course, the school
and child guidance center

00:30:25.662 --> 00:30:27.030
will be notified.

00:30:28.398 --> 00:30:29.365
Why is that?

00:30:29.432 --> 00:30:31.367
I’m fine with this,

00:30:31.434 --> 00:30:34.003
and so is Mr. Hatano and Mr. Sakuta.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.138
They're fine with it.

00:30:35.204 --> 00:30:38.541
What if you were to get sick
in the future?

00:30:40.176 --> 00:30:43.246
Or during exams, when you need
to fill out important documents?

00:30:43.313 --> 00:30:45.348
Think about it realistically.

00:30:45.415 --> 00:30:48.451
Right now, relying properly
on the systems in place

00:30:48.518 --> 00:30:50.186
is far safer and more reassuring.

00:30:50.753 --> 00:30:52.555
This is so you won’t suffer later.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:55.124
Please rely on them.

00:30:55.992 --> 00:30:57.894
That’s what I’m here for.

00:31:04.033 --> 00:31:04.901
Um…

00:31:05.435 --> 00:31:06.336
Yes?

00:31:09.539 --> 00:31:12.041
Let’s break up, Sakuta.

00:31:13.943 --> 00:31:15.278
-What?
-Huh?

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.584
I said if you say that again,
I’d really break up, didn't I?

00:31:23.353 --> 00:31:24.354
Yes.

00:31:24.854 --> 00:31:25.755
You're okay with that?

00:31:25.822 --> 00:31:27.156
-That can't be good.
-Yeah.

00:31:27.223 --> 00:31:28.391
That's not good.

00:31:28.458 --> 00:31:29.492
I'm okay with it.

00:31:31.928 --> 00:31:33.029
Sakuta…

00:31:35.131 --> 00:31:38.234
I don’t want you
to be held responsible at school.

00:31:39.202 --> 00:31:42.538
Neither do I want you
to be questioned by the police.

00:31:43.339 --> 00:31:45.208
It’s all my fault.

00:31:46.042 --> 00:31:47.243
Please break up with me.

00:31:48.378 --> 00:31:50.279
I did this because I wanted to.

00:31:50.346 --> 00:31:51.681
Sakuta and I…

00:31:52.315 --> 00:31:53.750
are strangers.

00:31:55.051 --> 00:31:56.619
We're not married and can never be.

00:31:58.087 --> 00:32:00.623
So, please do not mention his name

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:03.526
to the police, the school, or anyone else.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.261
I'm begging you!

00:32:07.463 --> 00:32:08.998
-Well…
-Please!

00:32:11.367 --> 00:32:12.201
Um…

00:32:15.271 --> 00:32:18.641
That's all you need to know
for today, am I right?

00:32:19.142 --> 00:32:20.710
-Yes.
-We will excuse ourselves now.

00:32:23.246 --> 00:32:24.080
What?

00:32:26.382 --> 00:32:27.316
Hey!

00:32:38.394 --> 00:32:40.029
Is this my fault?

00:32:40.096 --> 00:32:41.864
-Just get in!
-Okay.

00:32:43.132 --> 00:32:44.300
Um…

00:32:44.367 --> 00:32:46.135
I was thinking
if there’s anything I can do to help.

00:32:47.103 --> 00:32:48.938
Sorry, this is our problem.

00:32:50.306 --> 00:32:51.741
-Okay.
-Thanks, though.

00:33:02.318 --> 00:33:03.519
-What?
-Huh?

00:33:10.393 --> 00:33:12.795
Here. I'll give you this,

00:33:12.862 --> 00:33:14.597
so don't tell anyone I stole this.

00:33:14.664 --> 00:33:16.099
What? You stole it?

00:33:16.165 --> 00:33:17.266
Huh?

00:33:17.333 --> 00:33:18.334
I thought you saw me.

00:33:18.401 --> 00:33:21.871
What? Hey!

00:33:22.472 --> 00:33:23.739
Ah, you dropped something.

00:33:24.407 --> 00:33:25.708
Hey!

00:33:25.775 --> 00:33:28.277
Shall we postpone the viewing
to another day?

00:33:28.344 --> 00:33:29.612
Yes.

00:33:33.749 --> 00:33:34.650
You're not leaving?

00:33:36.285 --> 00:33:38.287
Well, I got curious.

00:33:38.354 --> 00:33:40.289
About Genichi and Mr. Sakuta?

00:33:40.356 --> 00:33:41.591
It's not exactly that

00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:44.694
I want those two to break up.

00:33:46.496 --> 00:33:50.166
That being said, I don't really understand
Mr. Hatano and the others.

00:33:50.733 --> 00:33:52.034
-I get you.
-What?

00:33:52.101 --> 00:33:53.069
Oh,

00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:55.471
I can relate for not understanding them.

00:33:56.739 --> 00:33:58.774
All kinds of people come to me.

00:33:59.675 --> 00:34:02.745
By that, I really mean all kinds.

00:34:02.812 --> 00:34:06.916
But, well, that’s what makes
my job interesting.

00:34:10.286 --> 00:34:11.320
I'll take my leave now.

00:34:14.323 --> 00:34:16.192
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:34:24.667 --> 00:34:25.601
Here you go.

00:34:25.668 --> 00:34:26.168
RESERVATION SLIP

00:34:26.235 --> 00:34:27.970
-Please wait a moment.
-Okay.

00:34:28.905 --> 00:34:32.375
-Is this the item you reserved?
-Yes.

00:34:34.777 --> 00:34:38.014
How’s this apartment? Do you like it?

00:34:39.982 --> 00:34:42.451
Do you live here too, Ms. Inokashira?

00:34:42.518 --> 00:34:44.687
I live alone, just behind here.

00:34:45.555 --> 00:34:47.657
But you're not alone, right?

00:34:47.723 --> 00:34:49.091
You're right.

00:34:49.158 --> 00:34:52.228
It might be too lively
to really call it living alone.

00:34:52.295 --> 00:34:55.031
People who aren't married
are called "single", right?

00:34:55.097 --> 00:34:58.134
Being single or currently living alone?

00:34:58.201 --> 00:34:59.068
Yes.

00:34:59.602 --> 00:35:00.770
I’m alone too.

00:35:00.836 --> 00:35:01.871
Same, me too!

00:35:02.538 --> 00:35:04.540
But you’re not really alone.

00:35:06.209 --> 00:35:07.076
Yeah.

00:35:07.944 --> 00:35:10.746
I want to aim for that too.

00:35:12.448 --> 00:35:13.516
Me?

00:35:16.652 --> 00:35:18.588
Make sure you reconcile properly.

00:35:19.288 --> 00:35:21.424
Adults shouldn’t sulk like this.

00:35:25.361 --> 00:35:26.362
Sorry for the wait.

00:35:27.964 --> 00:35:29.198
Can you hold this for me?

00:35:29.765 --> 00:35:30.766
Okay.

00:35:33.869 --> 00:35:34.704
It looks delicious!

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:36.539
Sorry, that's meant to be taken elsewhere.

00:35:36.606 --> 00:35:37.707
To where?

00:35:39.175 --> 00:35:41.143
Weren’t you looking forward to it?

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.049
I already have something else
to look forward to.

00:35:48.284 --> 00:35:51.287
Even more so than Christmas cake
or New Year’s food.

00:35:51.354 --> 00:35:52.355
Something much exciting.

00:35:57.293 --> 00:35:58.594
Hey, wait up!

00:35:58.661 --> 00:35:59.862
Shut up!

00:35:59.929 --> 00:36:01.597
How long are you going to follow me?

00:36:01.664 --> 00:36:03.966
That’s stealing! It’s a crime!

00:36:04.033 --> 00:36:05.434
You dropped this!

00:36:06.002 --> 00:36:08.337
-Ah, give that back!
-Huh?

00:36:08.404 --> 00:36:09.572
Hey!

00:36:10.339 --> 00:36:11.440
You’ll get arrested!

00:36:11.507 --> 00:36:12.575
What?

00:36:13.075 --> 00:36:16.212
People will think you’re a bad man!

00:36:16.279 --> 00:36:17.913
Stones will be thrown at you

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.282
from people around you.

00:36:19.348 --> 00:36:21.250
Who cares about that!

00:36:21.317 --> 00:36:22.718
I’m doing things my way!

00:36:23.286 --> 00:36:24.854
Ah, hey!

00:36:30.893 --> 00:36:32.728
-What's this place?
-This is a facility

00:36:32.795 --> 00:36:34.730
where I grew up until high school.

00:36:34.797 --> 00:36:38.100
CHILDREN’S HOME: HOSHINOOKA HOUSE

00:36:39.068 --> 00:36:42.204
If you'd like,
please share this with everyone.

00:36:42.271 --> 00:36:44.140
-Are you sure? Thanks.
-Of course.

00:36:44.206 --> 00:36:45.441
They’ll love it!

00:36:46.242 --> 00:36:47.810
And they are?

00:36:47.877 --> 00:36:48.811
Let me introduce them.

00:36:48.878 --> 00:36:51.514
Kanata and Micchan are fighting!

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.950
-Yume spilled her juice!
-Not again…

00:36:55.017 --> 00:36:56.919
Sorry, can you wait a moment?

00:36:56.986 --> 00:36:58.587
-We’ll return another time then.
-Oh, but…

00:36:58.654 --> 00:37:00.056
I came by to pass you this cake.

00:37:00.122 --> 00:37:01.457
Sorry about this.

00:37:01.524 --> 00:37:03.392
I'll see you again
when it's not so chaotic.

00:37:03.459 --> 00:37:05.194
-Yes.
-I'm so sorry.

00:37:05.261 --> 00:37:07.430
Hey, Kanata.

00:37:08.798 --> 00:37:11.267
-Come on now. Give that back.
-GIve it back!

00:37:11.334 --> 00:37:12.635
-It's mine!
-No…

00:37:21.344 --> 00:37:22.311
I'll try singing.

00:37:27.817 --> 00:37:32.188
I, I have a dream

00:37:32.788 --> 00:37:38.027
A dream of you and me

00:37:39.195 --> 00:37:44.233
We're flying high above

00:37:45.201 --> 00:37:51.107
We're soaring over the sea

00:37:52.041 --> 00:37:56.045
Bless me, bless me with wings

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.518
For I, so want to fly

00:38:03.519 --> 00:38:07.923
These precious white wings

00:38:09.125 --> 00:38:15.664
Will take me soaring high

00:38:18.601 --> 00:38:24.373
To the sun that lights the day
To the clouds that drift away

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:29.912
Only then will I be free

00:38:31.747 --> 00:38:37.153
Past the city lights and haze
Through the autumn trees ablaze

00:38:37.219 --> 00:38:42.625
In the sky I am truly free

00:38:43.426 --> 00:38:47.730
Just you and me

00:38:55.137 --> 00:38:57.740
This is the song everyone sang for me
when I left this facility.

00:38:58.474 --> 00:39:02.011
You said it would help me understand
my feelings if I sang, Hatano.

00:39:03.078 --> 00:39:04.280
How did you feel?

00:39:06.382 --> 00:39:07.883
I’m excited.

00:39:08.717 --> 00:39:09.552
Excited?

00:39:10.419 --> 00:39:13.622
The life at the facility was lively,
and everyone got along.

00:39:14.423 --> 00:39:17.460
We weren’t family,
but it felt like we really were.

00:39:18.561 --> 00:39:21.197
Still, by the rules at the time,

00:39:21.263 --> 00:39:24.467
we had to leave
once we graduated high school.

00:39:24.533 --> 00:39:27.803
When I left, I bawled my eyes out.

00:39:28.971 --> 00:39:31.207
That’s how much I loved…

00:39:32.341 --> 00:39:33.309
this place.

00:39:34.343 --> 00:39:38.180
So, I thought that someday

00:39:38.781 --> 00:39:41.417
I’d want to make a home like this myself.

00:39:43.152 --> 00:39:47.957
I knew it’d be tough since I’m gay.

00:39:48.023 --> 00:39:49.291
But even so…

00:39:49.925 --> 00:39:53.362
You know, to tell the truth,
I was a little…

00:39:53.863 --> 00:39:55.264
thrilled…

00:39:56.298 --> 00:39:59.435
when you said let's buy a house
and make it our "clamp".

00:40:00.703 --> 00:40:01.637
Even now,

00:40:02.671 --> 00:40:04.974
the fact that you're seriously
trying to buy a house

00:40:07.676 --> 00:40:08.711
makes me happy.

00:40:09.278 --> 00:40:10.513
More than I’ve ever been

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:13.048
about any other reservation.

00:40:15.751 --> 00:40:17.720
I'm really looking forward to it!

00:40:20.756 --> 00:40:21.957
I'm sorry.

00:40:23.893 --> 00:40:26.595
I won’t say anything
like "let’s break up" anymore.

00:40:28.597 --> 00:40:29.832
Let’s buy…

00:40:30.866 --> 00:40:31.934
a house for us both!

00:40:35.437 --> 00:40:36.272
What do you want?

00:40:36.338 --> 00:40:37.706
To reconcile.

00:40:38.274 --> 00:40:40.109
No, I don't want to do that here.

00:40:40.175 --> 00:40:41.744
No one’s watching.

00:40:50.619 --> 00:40:52.488
There’s something I want you to see.

00:40:52.555 --> 00:40:53.689
What is it?

00:40:54.323 --> 00:40:56.325
-I’ll come to your room later.
-Okay.

00:40:57.493 --> 00:40:59.595
I wonder what it is…

00:40:59.662 --> 00:41:00.729
Who knows?

00:41:09.438 --> 00:41:10.272
What's that?

00:41:10.339 --> 00:41:14.643
"I didn’t really understand
you two at all,

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:16.612
but it was incredibly interesting.

00:41:16.679 --> 00:41:20.316
So, please get along with each other."
It's from Ms. Matsu.

00:41:20.382 --> 00:41:21.417
What?

00:41:24.186 --> 00:41:27.222
Um, how about writing something like this
in the notarized contract?

00:41:27.823 --> 00:41:30.292
-What?
-"Even if we don’t understand each other,

00:41:30.359 --> 00:41:31.760
let’s enjoy it…

00:41:32.428 --> 00:41:33.662
and get along."

00:41:37.333 --> 00:41:38.167
Okay.

00:41:38.233 --> 00:41:40.369
After the beep tone,

00:41:40.436 --> 00:41:43.672
please leave your name and message.

00:41:43.739 --> 00:41:44.773
Hello.

00:41:45.407 --> 00:41:46.675
Mom, guess what?

00:41:46.742 --> 00:41:47.376
MOM

00:41:47.443 --> 00:41:49.979
I tried making a guitar out of cardboard…

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.281
but it turned out weird.

00:41:53.315 --> 00:41:56.652
I’m not even sure if it’s a guitar or not.

00:41:57.152 --> 00:41:58.020
NARA PICKLES

00:41:58.087 --> 00:42:00.656
Things that are between
guitar and not-guitar.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.659
Things that are between
family and not-family.

00:42:04.159 --> 00:42:06.261
Things that are between
parent and not-parent.

00:42:07.029 --> 00:42:09.598
There are so many things without names.

00:42:09.665 --> 00:42:10.499
There we go!

00:42:10.566 --> 00:42:12.167
One more left.

00:42:12.234 --> 00:42:13.068
SAITAMA, AICHI, FUKUSHIMA…

00:42:13.135 --> 00:42:14.203
But even those things

00:42:15.204 --> 00:42:18.574
can be just as important as the ones
that have names, right?

00:42:18.641 --> 00:42:20.075
PARTY B & C WILL SUPPORT PARTY A’S DREAM

00:42:20.142 --> 00:42:21.343
Mom--

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:23.479
The recording time has ended.

00:42:29.051 --> 00:42:31.153
Please come home soon…

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.621
Shall I

00:42:32.688 --> 00:42:34.023
take a picture for you?

00:42:34.923 --> 00:42:36.358
-What?
-Over there.

00:42:37.893 --> 00:42:39.595
Say cheese!

00:42:41.363 --> 00:42:42.698
Thank you.

00:42:42.765 --> 00:42:44.500
-Here you go!
-Thank you.

00:42:45.768 --> 00:42:46.869
That's hilarious.

00:42:49.204 --> 00:42:50.205
What?

00:42:52.875 --> 00:42:54.043
Huh?

00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:55.944
NARA SOUVENIR, DEER CRACKERS

00:42:57.079 --> 00:42:58.080
You made it?

00:42:58.914 --> 00:43:00.049
Yes.

00:43:01.183 --> 00:43:03.218
-Can I play it?
-Yes.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.294
You're a genius.

00:43:12.828 --> 00:43:14.229
Yeah.

00:43:14.296 --> 00:43:16.965
It really looks like a guitar!

00:43:17.032 --> 00:43:18.867
It’s really cute.

00:43:18.934 --> 00:43:20.969
Was this really
your first time making one?

00:43:21.036 --> 00:43:25.074
Yes. Even if I end up
in a child guidance center,

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.376
I want to be someone who makes guitars.

00:43:30.212 --> 00:43:32.948
Yeah, you definitely can! I know you can.

00:43:33.015 --> 00:43:35.217
You made something this amazing after all.

00:43:36.351 --> 00:43:38.787
Wait, did you decide the shape yourself?

00:43:38.854 --> 00:43:40.889
-Yes. Also…
-Hey.

00:43:40.956 --> 00:43:42.391
everyone drew on it too.

00:43:42.458 --> 00:43:44.827
-You’ve got talent for this.
-Hey, I said!

00:43:46.128 --> 00:43:47.229
There's a rabbit.

00:44:05.414 --> 00:44:06.648
It’s gone!

00:44:07.649 --> 00:44:08.684
The 30 million yen…

00:44:10.052 --> 00:44:11.253
What?

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.088
CHASU, CHAN

00:45:52.287 --> 00:45:54.189
