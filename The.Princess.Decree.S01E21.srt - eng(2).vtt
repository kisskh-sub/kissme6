00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.439
General.

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.239
Our spy has news.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.000
Yesterday, the Princess Royal
visited the Lotus Pavilion

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.560
in the name of worship,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.439
but met Li Yuanze there.

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:50.840
Her wedding is almost here,

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.200
yet she still cannot let him go.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.560
Xiao Pingning.

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:57.959
Li Yuanze.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.480
You will both pay for this.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.060
(Princess Royal Yong'an's Residence)

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.719
Your Highness.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.479
A message from Prince Wu'an.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.000
The wedding robe is prepared.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.479
He requests that you
enter the palace to try it on.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.479
I am tired.

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.080
Have the robe delivered
to my residence instead.

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:29.360
Your Highness, please

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:30.520
do consider

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.080
coming to the palace.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.479
And if I refuse?

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.919
Stand aside!

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.120
The Princess Royal truly has a temper.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.319
You

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.599
will enter the palace today,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.120
whether you want to or not.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.120
Otherwise,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.120
I will slaughter everyone
in your residence.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.800
You...

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.199
Your Highness.

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:28.719
Please.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.879
Where is the wedding robe?

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:11.360
Why rush?

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:13.759
Perhaps

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.120
it will be here soon enough.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.199
I heard

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:25.279
you went to Lotus Pavilion yesterday.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.360
I only accompanied my grandmother
to recite scriptures.

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:34.240
It seems

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:36.680
your brother's life

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.920
is not so important to you.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.000
Let...

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.800
Let go of me.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.079
After all I have done for you,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.439
you still deceive me time and again.

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:48.759
Answer me.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.040
Do you still care for Li Yuanze?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.959
I...

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:56.759
There is nothing

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.439
between him and me.

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:00.079
Good.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.040
Then let us see

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.720
whether he comes for you tonight.

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:09.240
General.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.170
If you wish to put someone to the test,

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:12.839
you should plan more carefully.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.959
With a trap this obvious,

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:17.360
who would walk into it?

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.920
Perhaps

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:23.199
someone would walk
into Your Highness's trap

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.199
of his own accord.

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:27.079
But

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:29.480
my patience is limited.

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:31.680
If he still does not appear...

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.360
Release her!

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.839
Li Yuanze.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.800
I should have killed you
when you urged me

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.920
to attack Beijiang.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.120
The Princess doesn't even know.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.199
Your beloved

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:53.279
went through quite some trouble

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.879
to rescue you from Beijiang.

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.720
First you used the name Mr. Qingya

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.120
to persuade me to wage war.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.160
Later, when the Second Prince
of Beijiang marched to war,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.319
you sent secret letters

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.959
to turn the two brothers
against each other.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.399
The Beijiang defense map.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.680
So carefully planned.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.279
Truly worthy of the Grand Secretary.

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.920
You staged every scene flawlessly,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.680
playing me for a fool.

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:37.879
Gan Sheng!

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.240
Li Yuanze.

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:46.560
You are the clean stream among scholars.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.279
I cannot kill you.

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:50.759
But Xiao Pingning is ruthless.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.240
If I kill her,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.360
I would rid the world of a scourge.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.000
Perhaps

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:59.920
history may even praise the deed.

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.560
What do you really want?

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:07.000
Since you two love acting so much,

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:08.680
why not join me

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:10.920
for one final performance?

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.199
Kill him.

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:21.240
Kill him and I will let the past go.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.800
What is it?

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:29.399
Can't bear to do it?

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:43.600
Do it!

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.920
Today one of you dies,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.839
and the other survives.
