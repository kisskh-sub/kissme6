[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.960
[Episode 36]

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.350
Pierce his shoulder blade with wire!

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.100
[Hall of Loyalty]

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.000
Don't! Don't!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.590
Let's talk nicely—

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.560
You want to pierce his shoulder blade?

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.150
Yes.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.270
I'll do it right in front of you.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.180
Let me tell you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.350
what's so good about this hairpin.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.789
Go ahead.

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:51.720
Tell me about it.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:56.229
Look.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.890
It's...

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.170
-Grab her!
-Grab her!

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.830
Don't move!

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.690
If any of you move or speak again,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.840
I'll pierce his other shoulder blade

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.630
as well.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.910
With both your shoulder blades damaged,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.360
you won't be able

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.360
to do anything for the rest of your life.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.979
Understand?

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.240
Nod if you understand.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.120
My goodness!

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.320
That's my knife!

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.280
What do you say now,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.790
Boss?

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.590
You damn woman!

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.150
Even if you kill me today,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.950
it's of no use.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.470
My Cao Gang

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.400
has hundreds of thousands of disciples.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.730
They could drown you
with just their spit!

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.750
So you martial heroes

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.910
kill people

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.280
with spit?

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.710
I...

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.360
Release our boss!

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.710
[Hall of Loyalty]

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.490
-Let him go!
-Release him!

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.980
Boss Gui.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.079
Boss Gui.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.760
Brothers! Brothers!

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.030
My daughter misses her husband terribly.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.250
We made a mistake.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.120
As for this matter,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.720
after we go back,

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.030
we'll gather some elders

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.710
and clear this up face to face.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.370
I will apologize—

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.360
it's all on me.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.400
Why are you wasting words on them?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.280
They're just a bunch of filthy thieves!

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.280
Who are you calling filthy thieves?

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.150
Who is she?

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.650
W-What do you mean?

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.520
Ms. Su. Who is she?

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.430
I told you before.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.150
She's Ms. Su,
who released the prisoners of war.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.950
You're lying.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.190
No, really.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.840
Didn't you say

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.280
you would never see her again?

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.560
Why did you go looking for her again?

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.000
She's capable, isn't she?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.240
No, I'm not saying you're incapable.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.030
You could save me too.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.630
I was just worried about your safety.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.120
Martial arts matters should be settled
in the martial arts world.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.630
I don't understand martial arts matters,
is that it?

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.750
Or do you think I can't save you?

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.680
I'll cut off his head

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.150
right now—

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.150
do you believe me?

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.040
Don't be impulsive! Calm down!

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.910
Don't say these things here.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.460
Don't talk about this
in front of outsiders.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.000
I've been watching over Mother
for 15 days.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.800
As soon as Mother woke up,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.750
she asked for you.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.470
If you don't go back today,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.530
I won't know what to tell her anymore.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.490
Mother is awake?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.020
Yes, she is.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.060
Must've been hard on you.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.630
Excuse me.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.770
I'm sorry

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.740
to interrupt.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.240
Young girl,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.120
could you loosen

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.280
your grip a little?

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.400
I'm having trouble

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.590
breathing here.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.350
Daughter.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.010
How about this?

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.000
Why don't you go home?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.630
Continue your argument there.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.160
Let's consider this matter

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.390
settled.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:21.829
Okay.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.600
Settled?

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.000
Shall we?

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.230
Of course not.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.820
Why did you kidnap him?

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.620
Hey, heroine!

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.750
Don't push your luck.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.570
Boss.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.800
-Boss Gui.
-We have an important guest.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.970
What important guest?

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:40.390
Where did this so-called important guest
come from?
[Hall of Loyalty]

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.650
Is this the important guest you brought?

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.920
You all seem to be having fun.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.170
Putting on quite a show.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.870
Move aside!

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.920
-Move!
-Move!

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.480
Move!

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.440
[Hall of Loyalty]

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.310
Put that knife down.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.980
You might kill him accidentally.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.830
You brat.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.360
I'm settling this score

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.220
with you today.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.670
Such a temper.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.390
So we can't get to an agreement,
right?

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.310
Definitely not!

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.909
This is a great humiliation!

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:39.270
If we can't reach an agreement, then fine.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.470
Kill him. I'll talk to the Deputy Chief.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.500
I'll give you a way out.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.190
This man

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.720
is wanted
by the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.600
A lone fighter
can't win against authority.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.860
If you don't let him go,

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.510
I'll leave immediately.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.220
Open it and see.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.780
Is the seal of the Viceroy of Liangjiang

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.390
[Rui Lin's Stamp]

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.050
enough to convince you?

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.070
Civilians don't fight against officials.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.600
I

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.860
must have been blind.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.550
Mr. Gu,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.230
my apologies.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:39.550
Mr. Chang,

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.420
my apologies.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.280
Boss Gui,

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.430
my apologies.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.159
Madam Gu,

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:48.000
you have impressive knife skills.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.130
It seems from now on,

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.900
when I see a woman with a knife,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.580
I should keep my distance.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.510
You think keeping your distance will help?

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.640
Look at your candle.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.240
Amazing aim!

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.170
[Cao]

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.850
Father,

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.400
how are you feeling?

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.560
Where are you going?

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.040
I'm going ahead to take care of something.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.040
There's nothing for you to do there.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.040
The old monk from Jinshan Temple

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.430
wants to hold
a grand Water and Land Dharma Assembly.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.960
I think this is a good thing.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.040
Since our Li family

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.570
has arrived in Liangjiang,

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.270
we can't let people say

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.870
we're only here to make money.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.470
Saying prayers for the dead,

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.310
burning incense and paper offerings,

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.800
and making the living grateful.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.130
I think this investment

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.250
is worthwhile.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.920
We've been spending quite a lot lately,

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.270
but I'm competing with Gu Pingyuan.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.270
Once I win...

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.950
You think defeating Gu Pingyuan

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.560
means you've won?

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:56.750
Father,

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.220
if I've done something wrong,

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.830
please tell me directly.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.000
Everything boils down to connections.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.730
Do you think the Viceroy of Liangjiang

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.460
doesn't know
Gu Pingyuan is smuggling salt?

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.260
Would he just sit by and watch you

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.750
take over all the salt fields

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.840
and become

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.120
an unofficial king of Jiangnan?

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.690
They will never allow

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.510
you to succeed in this.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.320
I did take over

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.240
all the salt fields and stores.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.200
But I didn't want that much.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.120
You can't leave him
without a single penny.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.320
With the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.440
backing him up,

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.750
Gu Pingyuan won't fall.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.600
Father,

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.390
do you think

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.320
I can't defeat Gu Pingyuan?

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.100
You can't defeat Liangjiang

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.750
nor the regime.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.960
This is not how business is done.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.390
Just now,

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.480
you really scared me.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.120
You think I'm meddling?

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.870
No.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:45.870
Didn't I tell you?

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:46.910
I was worried about your safety.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.910
I was worried about your safety too.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.360
My wife is

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.830
cool and valiant,

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.950
with unmatched knife skills.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.380
From now on, wherever you go,

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.850
everyone would show you

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.790
some respect.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.790
What you said is true,

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.390
but stop sweet-talking me.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.840
If Ms. Su hadn't

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.750
arrived in time,

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.630
I really wouldn't have known

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:15.320
what to do next.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.390
Let me say it again.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.720
Even if Ms. Su didn't come,

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.580
I could still get you out of there.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.600
I thought

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.200
you were just pretending to be jealous

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.360
to buy some time.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:25.410
Is that right?

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.250
Well, I

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.000
was acting jealous.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.500
Do you

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.630
really think I would actually

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:36.510
be jealous of her?

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.340
Or do you think

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.600
she would be interested in you?

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.120
No.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.260
I'm afraid you won't be interested in me.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.030
Are you not going

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.030
to go talk to the person in the cabin?

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.200
Then come with me.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.080
I'm afraid my legs
will go weak if I see her alone.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.480
Stop it. Go by yourself.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:00.510
Go and

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.730
thank her properly.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.550
Ms. Su, may I come in?

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.670
Please.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.790
Thank you for your help, Ms. Su.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.320
When I left,

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:29.720
Rui Lin insisted I bring

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.850
the Viceroy of Liangjiang.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.270
You should thank him.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.120
If I weren't forced into this situation,

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.750
I wouldn't want to trouble them.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.300
You're working for them,

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:41.960
protecting the Liangjiang salt fields

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.750
from being monopolized by the Li family.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.480
They don't mind troubling you,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.000
so what are you afraid of?

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.040
I'm afraid
I won't be able to return to Huizhou.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.120
In this salt field dispute,

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.600
Li Qin is bound to lose.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.320
Your contribution is significant.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.430
In a few years,

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.720
you'll surely become

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.520
the wealthiest man in Jiangnan.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.960
Why return to the tiny Huizhou?

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.290
What would you do there?

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.530
Farm and sell tea?

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.790
I'm doing what I know is impossible.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.750
I was too young before,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.960
and thought of business too simply.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.700
Back then, I wanted to seek truth,

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.910
believing business

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.310
could benefit the world,

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.790
help those in poverty,

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.520
and save people from hardship.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:26.600
But gradually,

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.780
as my horizons broadened,

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.800
that thought disappeared.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:35.840
What do you mean?

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.740
Looking at ourselves,

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.150
we're either fighting for power
or internally,

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.680
ignorant of global trends,

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.000
like frogs in a well—

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.000
myself included.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.570
On a smaller scale,
I can help myself.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.870
But on a larger scale,
I can help the country.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.200
If I could truly do something

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.200
for this country,

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.810
I wouldn't care about my personal safety.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.580
I know this sounds presumptuous.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.460
Please forgive my boldness.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.420
Mr. Gu, you have a visitor.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:06.910
Mr. Gu,

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:08.130
please.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.210
I'll go with you.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.480
The Cao Gang
has many tricks up their sleeve.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.240
I'm afraid
you might be taken advantage of.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.100
It's Mr. Li Qin.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.120
It'll be fine.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.080
Well,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.550
be careful.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.400
I just recovered from illness.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.390
I'm still weak, so I'll stay seated.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.220
Li Qin told me about it.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.440
Please stay seated.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.570
What can I do for you?

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.000
People who'd stayed in Ningguta
for a long time

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.840
all undergo some changes.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.420
That place

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.650
is filled with all kinds of evil forces.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.640
You escaped unharmed

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.970
and didn't lose yourself.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.150
That place is indeed crawling with demons.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.360
Otherwise, why would they risk

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.510
their lives just to escape?

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.440
But the more you're in such places,

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.320
the more you understand
the value of kindness.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.670
Why should you,

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.150
when among wolves,

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.480
become a wolf yourself?

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.360
I heard you've had trouble

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.360
with the Cao Gang.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.720
This isn't a good thing.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.460
Even with Ms. Su

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.680
forcefully resolving it for you,

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.490
it's still useless.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.490
You're selling salt on the waterways.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.480
The Cao Gang doesn't even need to show up.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.940
They just need to report you
along the route.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.890
No matter how powerful
the Viceroy of Liangjiang is,

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.350
can he really reach beyond Liangjiang?

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.360
This is a dead end.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.080
I've been in business for many years.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.150
There are some things

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.790
you should listen to.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.910
The worst thing in the world

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:20.670
is a price war.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.910
No one can win.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.720
It's a lose-lose situation.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.910
It doesn't end
till someone's at a dead end.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.890
Don't continue this any further.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.450
Let me tell you what.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.370
The Cao Gang owes me a favor.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.750
I'll step in

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.950
and settle this dispute for you.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.590
You withdraw from the conflict.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.030
As for the Viceroy of Liangjiang,

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.830
I'll speak to him on your behalf.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.070
With all due respect, you're my senior,

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.660
and I shouldn't talk back.

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.030
But for this matter,

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.290
I really cannot agree.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:56.690
Please forgive me.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:00.770
You don't understand.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.550
You're just a pawn

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.680
of the Liangjiang government office.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.360
Do they really care

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.920
about the
people's livelihood in Lianghuai?

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.360
Once the crisis is over,

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.650
you'll be discarded.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.410
Let me be frank with you.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.000
Rui Lin has been playing tricks

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.600
in Liangjiang territory.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.200
He wants to become
the Chief Grand Councilor,

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.240
and Liangjiang is just his stepping stone.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.750
You're just a part

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.240
of that stepping stone.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:30.600
I know.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:31.750
No, you don't.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.200
If someone

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.840
submits a petition
to the government office

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.320
claiming that you, as an official,

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.780
are selling illegal salt,

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.150
the imperial court
will immediately send men

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.150
to arrest you.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.810
I'd like to see who will help you then.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.550
The amount of illegal salt
you're trafficking is too large.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:49.950
No one dares
to take responsibility for it.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.200
Worst case scenario,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.480
three generations of your family
will be punished.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.610
Best case scenario,

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.520
they'll just send you back to Ningguta.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:16:59.760
How capable are you?

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.200
How many more times
can you escape from there?

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.680
I'll help you solve your problems.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.599
You should

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:10.530
take your mother

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.410
and settle down in your hometown.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.349
We're not friends nor family,

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:22.829
right?

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:29.000
Yes.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.480
Back in Shanxi,

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.640
I sabotaged your business.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:34.960
In the capital,

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.270
I caused chaos
at your Grand Tea Competition.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.920
In Shanghai,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.650
I broke your tea trading rules.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:40.920
Now in Lianghuai,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.660
we're competitors again.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.690
I know I'm just a pawn.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.410
I also know

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.400
you can crush me to dust

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.030
just by lifting your little finger.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.360
If you wanted to harm me,

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.830
I would've been dead many times over.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:55.520
But why

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:56.680
haven't you done so?

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.920
Don't talk to me about appreciation

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.550
or trust.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.220
I don't believe it.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.210
What do you really want?

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.430
We're birds of a feather—

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.530
I don't want to destroy you.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.180
You and I are the same kind.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.460
Compared to Li Qin,

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:19.880
you're more like...

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.310
you're more like me.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.890
With your skills,

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.130
how sly you are,

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.800
by the time you reach my age,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.400
you'd be quite somebody.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.920
Let me be frank.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.170
Your troubles,

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.940
I'll take care of them all.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.210
Take your brother,

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.440
your mother, and your wife,

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.240
and return to your hometown in Anhui.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.720
Don't you like growing tea?

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.250
Go ahead.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.410
You like reading? Go ahead.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.830
Live the life you want.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.590
After I'm gone,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.130
you can return to the business world.

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:03.750
The world will be yours.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.860
People say I own half the city.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.110
But I believe

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.600
with your achievements,

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.400
you will

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.510
far surpass me in the future.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.160
Guangfa.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.480
Master.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.990
Has the letter to the Cao Gang been sent?

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:30.640
It has.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.390
Those old men said

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.270
they weren't aware
of Mr. Gu's noble status

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:37.070
and want to apologize in person.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:39.920
Good.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.010
I've met many great merchants in my life.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.220
But only you

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.320
almost fooled me just now.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.550
You truly are a leader.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.150
I'm impressed.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:59.880
What do you mean by that?

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.590
Coming down to it,
you're half-official, half-merchant.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:05.700
If the salt industry
falls into your hands,

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.400
how would it be any different from before?

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.270
You can work outside

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.920
doing business for the Sixth Prince.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.480
You can even send
the Viceroy of Liangjiang

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.610
to the Grand Council

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.110
to become the Chief Minister.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:14.880
And me?

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.690
I'm just an ordinary citizen.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.770
What am I fighting for?

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.960
All I'm fighting for is

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.760
equality for all salt merchants

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.330
and freedom for salt farmers to trade.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.590
When one family dominates everything,

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.240
common people suffer.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.040
Rui Lin told me

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.720
he wanted to use this war

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.780
to return the Lianghuai salt industry
to its people—

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.510
back to the 175 merchants

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.240
of the Lianghuai Salt Industry Guild

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.970
for them to manage it together.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.070
I don't mind being a pawn.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.310
Because I agree, and I believe in

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.050
what he's trying to do.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.590
So I

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:55.680
willingly work for him.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.680
It's that simple.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.880
Goodbye.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.170
Do you want to return to Ningguta?

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.480
Everything comes with risks.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:08.590
Should I dig a hole

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:09.590
and hide myself instead?

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.640
Your crime will affect
three generations of yours.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.500
Your mother has suffered enough.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:14.770
Even if you want to die,

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.440
wait until after she passes away.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.440
As a son,

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.160
have you no filial piety?

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.620
I've said what I needed to say.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.690
Whether you listen is up to you.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.200
Master,

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.680
please calm down.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.580
Write a letter to the Cao Gang.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:07.310
Tell them

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.160
all disciples
involved in today's salt raid,

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.440
regardless of rank,

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.570
must take an oath

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.570
to never reveal anything.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.640
Check if there are any other issues

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.570
with his smuggled salt operation.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.160
Help resolve

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.580
all of them.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.110
Yes, Master.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.830
Well...

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.880
What about Young Master?

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:03.310
Mother.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.110
[Tranquility of Autumn]

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:06.680
Mother.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.240
I heard you were awake
as soon as I got back.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.310
I just woke up.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.450
Where did this spinning wheel come from?

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.180
I asked Yu'er to find one for me.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.480
I guess I haven't worked for too long

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.450
and got sick from idleness.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.210
Something on your mind?

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.590
How come

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:48.430
you slept for so long before?

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.330
I don't know either.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.590
What did the doctor say?

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.350
The doctor...

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.970
He couldn't figure it out either.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:08.390
Pingyuan.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.150
Mr. Li is looking for you.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.310
Okay.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.000
I got it.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.280
So you have free time now?

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:29.000
I brought you some

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.270
premium lingzhi mushrooms.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.680
I heard your mother woke up.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.540
Lingzhi powder

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.400
is best for calming one's mind.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.000
Thank you.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:42.200
Just name your price.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:44.160
Let's stop fighting like this.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.760
I don't want to be your enemy.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.400
I'm not your enemy.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.270
We're both just

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:52.880
pawns that are crossing the river.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.940
How can we retreat?

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.550
Where can we retreat to?

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:55.880
Well,

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.030
then when will this fight

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:57.960
ever end?

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.070
The Liangjiang Viceroy's Office

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.310
will never hand over all the Lianghuai salt fields

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.780
to your Li family.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.110
You're not fighting with me,

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.320
but with the whole government.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.350
On a bigger scale,

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.410
you are fighting against the regime.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.790
Can you win?

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.030
If I can win,

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.550
at least the Lianghuai salt industry

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:18.640
will be under my control.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.830
The way we're burning money now

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.100
makes no sense at all.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.270
Why not just let me

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.970
take it all?

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:25.810
You're too greedy.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:27.940
What's wrong with being greedy?

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.470
We're merchants after all.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.510
These are things

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:31.680
I knew even when

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.810
I was a kid studying.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.200
I won't waste my breath

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.600
telling you them now too.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:37.310
Come on,

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:38.200
[Ledger]

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.130
write down how much you'll donate.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:41.480
I am sponsoring

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.200
a Water and Land Dharma Assembly
at Jinshan Temple

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.550
to pray for the deceased
of the Seven Provinces of Jiangnan.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:46.270
Pay up!

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:50.430
Why are you
getting even more short-tempered?

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:12.970
By the way,

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.480
how is your father doing?

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:16.850
What's that to you?

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.310
Wait.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:23.440
Let's

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:24.510
go together

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.640
to the Liangjiang government office.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.540
Some things

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.720
are better discussed face to face.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.850
Let me tell you this:

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:35.430
I'm no longer interested

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.190
in the salt business now.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:39.680
Hand over half of the salt fields

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.080
your family bought over,

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.680
and split it
with the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.280
With that,

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.280
I can return to Anhui
to grow tea immediately.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.880
I've closed half

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.790
of my family's profitable shops,

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.590
offended everyone I could possibly offend,

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.310
and now you want me to give up
half of my salt business?

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.700
Do...

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:57.960
Do you think I'm a joke?

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.790
Are you joking with me

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.000
or do you just want to see me
make a fool of myself?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.510
Li Qin.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:02.260
I'm not your enemy.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.000
Is it funny?

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.880
No.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.690
I used to

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.810
work at a pawnshop in Shanxi.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.820
In my opinion,

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.110
those old pawnbrokers' abacus skills

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.430
are no match

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.640
in terms of proficiency

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.110
for you, Sir

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.880
They don't tally
that many accounts in a day.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.550
I'm managing the livelihood

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:51.750
of two provinces.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.640
The officials' accounts

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:54.880
have to be right.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:58.310
Sir.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.970
I return this seal intact.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.950
Thank you for your help, Sir.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.290
Even if I hadn't helped,

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.410
they couldn't have said anything.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.270
I just wanted that

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.750
young man Li to know

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.010
that he should consult me first

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:18.310
before causing trouble
in Liangjiang territory.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:20.680
I apologize to you, Sir.

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.390
As for the smuggled salt,

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:24.550
let's stop it.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
If word gets out

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.550
and people learn

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.160
that people
from the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.020
are connected to salt smugglers,

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:34.530
wouldn't that make you a laughingstock?

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.400
A laughingstock?

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.080
If word gets out

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.290
and people learn

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:41.590
that the biggest salt industry
in Liangjiang

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.160
slipped through my fingers,

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.290
that would be the real laughingstock.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:46.780
Don't worry,

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:47.820
next time,

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.440
I'll use government ships
to transport them for you.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.170
No need, Sir.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:51.550
The price war—

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.810
let's not continue it.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:54.310
Although it doesn't harm

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:55.510
the government much,

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.110
the Li family has already

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.880
sold half

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.720
of their profitable shops because of this.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.040
It seems it's time

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.410
to convince him.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.530
Have you convinced him?

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.350
I haven't.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.830
The hardest thing
to eliminate in this world

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:12.270
is greed.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.760
[Jinshan Temple]

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:25.200
Tanyue,

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.060
please come in.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.130
Thank you, Master.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:37.350
I think

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.680
getting half of the salt fields
is not bad.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.590
You can't win
the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office.

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:43.300
Father,

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.070
we've sold so many shops

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.920
and invested so much money.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.720
How can you ask me
to let go at this point?

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.240
Enough.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.300
In front of Buddha,

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.310
don't speak

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.930
words tainted with greed.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:52.880
Father,

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:54.400
without offerings from everywhere,

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.750
even the Bodhisattva
cannot become the Bodhisattva.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:56.510
I really don't understand

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:57.770
what you said just now.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.830
If you're truly afraid,

00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:59.590
I'll listen to you.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.240
I'll go to the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office
right now

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.720
and kowtow to admit my mistake.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.590
But I don't understand

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:04.680
why you're so afraid.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.940
What are you afraid of?

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:29.110
Mr. Gu.

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:35.000
How are you?

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.110
If you died, so be it.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.500
Why are you tormenting the child?

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.400
Even if you come back and kill me,

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.440
there's no need need to harm him.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.000
Father.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.720
What's going on?

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.550
Every debt must be paid.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:12.920
No one wants your debt.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.040
We assumed you died in the capital.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.950
I alone

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:19.920
raised two children.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:23.450
The elder one was good at studying

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.570
so he wanted to go to the capital
to seek a better life.

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.480
Before leaving, he told me

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:31.960
he was going to

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.830
find your remains for burial.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.000
When I saw him off,

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.440
I was inexplicably worried—

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.880
I couldn't breathe.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.160
I didn't know

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.590
what I was worried about.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:47.790
Now I know.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.650
All that nonsense about him causing chaos
in the examination hall,

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:55.440
was all your doing.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.240
Mother.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.680
H-He is...

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.070
Take a good look.

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:12.070
This is the father that had died

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.310
for 20 years.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.790
His surname used to be Gu!

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.540
Old Madam Gu...

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:25.690
Old Madam Gu...

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.440
My... My father's surname is Li.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.750
He's the son of the Li family
from the south of the city.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.480
My mother said he married into our family

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.640
after his family fell on hard times.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.070
I...

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:38.070
Father,

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.110
is that true?

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.000
So,

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.360
the person who sabotaged me
at the examination hall back then

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.450
was you.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.440
I knew you came to the capital.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.600
I was worried
if you really passed the exam,

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:20.680
this show couldn't go on anymore.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.780
I changed my identity,

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.480
and reborn into a new life.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.610
That I cut all my ties

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.370
was their requirement.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:43.350
Mother...

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.240
You've mistaken him for someone else.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.260
How could he possibly be my father?

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.960
My father died

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.960
on his way
to take the imperial examination.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.160
His remains are nowhere to be found now.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.960
And he is nothing but

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.000
an old fool who married into

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:01.920
a rich family.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.090
How could he possibly be my father?

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.590
Mother,

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:10.760
it's windy outside.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.480
Let's not stay here anymore.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:15.250
I'll take you home.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.000
I'll go back with you.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:20.110
Mother.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:21.550
Come.

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:34.190
Mother.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.480
Steady yourself.

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.830
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:40.840
I'm here with you.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.550
I'm with you.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:55.860
Father.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.000
Father.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.030
Mother,

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.600
have some tea.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:19.960
You need to believe what I said.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.960
I want to believe you too.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:27.670
But that's not true.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.550
Mother,

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:39.090
let me do some math for you.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:42.720
Life is only about 70 years.

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:45.550
With 10 years of ignorance,

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:47.550
and 10 years of old age and weakness,

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:49.280
that leaves us with only 50.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.650
We sleep when it's dark,

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.020
and the time we're truly awake

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.710
is at most 25 years.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.130
If we encounter illness or disasters,

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.610
running around

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:02.470
and suffering from heartbreak,

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:03.510
how much time is really left

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:05.070
for us to be happy?

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.360
Why torture yourself

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:09.840
over those troubles?

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.510
Just now,

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.280
when you said he wasn't your father,

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.580
the weight in my heart

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.980
was finally lifted.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.400
I have you,

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.940
Pingwen,

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.070
and Yu'er—

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.000
I have so many of you.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:40.550
I should say

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.400
I'm living a good life.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.560
Of course we're living a good life.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.520
Many families would envy what you have.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.150
So

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:58.440
I won't fool myself anymore.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.800
Decades of heartache,

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.440
and now at this age,

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.610
I can finally let it go.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.230
I'll go see him

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:27.440
and tell him

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.320
that I've moved on.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.360
Let him

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:37.360
see to it himself.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.030
That's right.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.840
That's exactly how you should think.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.440
It's okay.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:49.990
Everything will be fine.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:52.230
Yu'er,

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:54.110
get mother something to eat.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.970
I'll go see

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.410
if they've left yet.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:18.960
What are you doing here?

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:20.350
Where's your father?

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.320
You need to leave.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.320
We don't know you.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.440
Let him in.

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:35.600
What happened to your hair?

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.920
I asked the abbot here

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.060
to give me the tonsure.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.590
These 3,000 troublesome hairs

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.480
are gone, and that's that.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.400
I'll spend my remaining years here
vegetarian and chanting sutras,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.590
atoning for my sins.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.530
You're even abandoning your son?

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:01.630
My life

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.250
is over.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.000
Yes.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.570
It's all in the past.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:09.840
Spending the rest of your life here

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.560
praying to Buddha and being vegetarian—

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.800
you have the Bodhisattva's protection.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.800
So, no matter what sins

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.200
you'd committed before,

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.630
you won't face retribution.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:21.030
What a deal.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:21.840
Gu Pingyuan.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.930
Did you come here to mock me?

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:28.050
You think I wanted to come?

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:32.750
My mother asked me to deliver a message.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.550
She has let this matter go.

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.980
She hopes you can live well

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.360
and forgive yourself.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:47.720
Stop making things sound so good here.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:50.880
You have no right to speak here.

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.640
I have one more thing to say.

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:59.370
Even if all the gods and Buddhas

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.440
can forgive you,

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.800
can you forgive yourself?

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.960
Wait.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:36.880
You don't know what I've been through.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:39.760
In times of chaos,

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:42.320
I was robbed of everything

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.780
even before entering the examination hall.

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.230
I fell ill in the wilderness

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.470
and caught the epidemic.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:51.590
I realized...

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.720
that poor people's lives

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.960
are as worthless as grass.

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:01.720
If you die of illness,
you get eaten up by dogs.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.240
If you get buried on the streets,

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:05.710
you get eaten up by ants.

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:08.150
I was in despair

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.670
until I met your mother.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.700
The Young Lady of the Li family
wasn't married then.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.730
With no male heir in her family,

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.100
she managed the vast business

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.110
all by herself.

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:29.360
With her,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.360
I made my first business deal ever.

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.840
I changed my name,

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:40.790
and abandoned my wife and children.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.230
I lived like someone

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:45.920
who was born wealthy,

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.400
starting a new life.

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:53.070
I think you all

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:54.670
would have been tempted too.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.190
I sold my soul

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:02.630
and betrayed my ancestors.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.960
Son,

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.550
you were born into wealth.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.920
All of this I gave you,

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.630
traded with my own self.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:19.750
In this world,

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:22.230
everyone else can mock me

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.400
and curse me,

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:25.510
but you cannot.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:30.280
I thought back then

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:36.280
even if I fell into hell forever,

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.840
I couldn't stay poor anymore.
