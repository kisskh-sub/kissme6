00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.500
Why is it so expensive?

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.060
Isn't it normally $8 to Macau?

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:07.730
These people

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.180
are the targets the Japanese

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.540
are looking to capture.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.260
If we don't dispatch the boats now,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.690
they may lose their only chance

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:14.690
to escape.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:15.690
This will cause immense loss

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.900
to China in warfare and in our future.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.180
Sorry, Mr. Liang.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.420
You should talk to the Japanese
about this instead.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.970
Portugal is a neutral country.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.940
They don't care
who will lose more in this war,

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.570
neither will they choose
between China and Japan.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.300
Inspector General Gonçalves.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.100
The cruelty of the Japanese army

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.230
has long been proved
by countless bloody facts.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.690
Don't you know that?

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.020
Portugal is indeed a neutral country.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.810
But even if it's out of humanism,

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.900
the neutral country
should help the refugees.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.900
If you want to save the Chinese,

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.900
you Chinese should think of a way.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.850
Order Steamship Sai On
to shut off immediately,

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.330
and it is not allowed to leave the port.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.140
Yes, sir.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.540
Xian,

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.900
what should we do now?

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:09.940
Are you cold?

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:47.780
Look!

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:48.810
What's that?

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.330
Hey!

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.810
Hey!

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.490
We're here to pick you up!

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.690
Hey!

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.210
We're here to pick you up!

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:18.690
How much is it?

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:19.780
Miss, how much is it?

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.180
How much?

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:20.970
It's free.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.490
I'll send you to Macau for free.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:23.570
It's really free.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.210
Ms. Qiao.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:29.570
Ms. Qiao, come quickly!

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:30.090
Yu!

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:30.970
Mr. He!

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.540
Mr. He!

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.300
Yu?

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:35.450
Yu!

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:40.970
Yu!

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.240
You know that kid?

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:44.940
She's a kid from a Boat Dweller family

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.380
I met in Macau.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.600
Be careful.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:07.940
Yu,

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.010
thank you so much.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:10.810
Without you,

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.330
we wouldn't be able to leave today.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.450
Don't mention it.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.330
Didn't you help me last time?

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.540
Is your information correct?

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.810
The coastal guard's report
very clearly stated that

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.420
a large number of Chinese boats

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.650
are heading to Macau
through the Lingding Channel.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:27.810
[Macau Governor, De Solaire]

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.060
They're already very near to Macau pier.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.660
Hong Kong has just fallen.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.180
Don't let the mess fall upon Macau.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:36.780
Order the Navy to dispatch all ships

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.210
to deploy to the maritime boudary.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:39.970
Are we intercepting those Chinese boats?

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.380
The ship is full of civilians.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.300
How can we intercept them?

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.140
Sink them?

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.900
I'm talking about putting up the boundary.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.170
Ms. Qiao.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:53.690
Why are you alone?

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.060
Where's Mr. Qiao?

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.610
This is the Japanese Navy.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.540
All ships that are leaving

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.660
without permission

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.380
are to return immediately.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.940
Those not obeying
will be shot down.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:15.570
Fire!

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:26.420
Get down!

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.660
Get down!

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:38.970
Dad!

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.450
Mom!

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:42.690
Mom!

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:43.570
-Yu's mom!
-Mother!

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:44.210
Xian!

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.330
Bring Mommy back.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.540
Come in quickly!

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.610
It's dangerous!

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:48.900
Xian!

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.140
Don't go out anymore!

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:51.970
Xian!

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.110
-Come in!
-Xian!

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.850
Xian, come in.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:55.900
It's dangerous!

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:58.540
Third Uncle!

00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.830
Look over there!

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:01.810
This is the Macau sea.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.790
Other than civilian ships,

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.610
-all armed ships are not allowed to enter.
-Portuguese warships.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.180
Hurry!

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.300
Go that way.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:08.900
Okay.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:11.830
Haishan.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.750
Hurry up, bring all the comrades with guns

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:14.790
to my ship.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:33.660
Mommy!

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:40.730
Xian.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:41.780
Water keeps coming in.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:42.810
The water in the boat is too deep!

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.690
It's sinking! What should we do?

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.180
Brother!

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:15.570
Rizhang!

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.570
The cannonboat we sent out

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.690
was hit by an unknown speedboat.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.810
The ship was flooded and became immobile.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.300
The two other boats sent out subsequently

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.810
were stopped by Macau's navy

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.810
near Macau's maritime boundary.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.090
General.

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:59.730
Are we forcibly entering the Macau sea?

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.390
Awaiting your instructions.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.210
The fleeing British troops

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.570
possess too much military

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.330
and financial intelligence
about Hong Kong.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.900
We must catch them.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.570
However,

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.810
the headquarters has not yet finalized
its strategy for Macau.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.570
It is not advisable to have direct
conflicts with Portugal at this time.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.380
We have no choice but to order them
to turn back.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.110
Understood.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.810
Regarding the intelligence
on those targets,

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.690
immediately send a telegram

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.550
to Colonel Sawa and Consul Fukue,

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:40.490
instructing them to coordinate the capture
at once.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.210
Yes, sir.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.260
Yu!

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.450
Go! Get outside quickly!

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.180
Go! Go! Go!

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:46.690
Hurry!

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.490
Boats are coming!

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.020
Boats are coming!

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:50.730
Mommy!

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.060
Boats are coming!

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:52.810
Yu!

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.090
-Come! Yu, get on the boat quickly!
-Yu's mom!

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:54.970
Be careful.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:55.730
Take it slow. The leg.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:56.660
Careful with the leg.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.490
It's injured.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.330
Let's go, Zai!

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:58.970
Zai!

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:00.060
Dad.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.140
-Come. Get on the boat.
-Hurry.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:01.970
Where's Little Miss?

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:03.610
She's here!

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.010
Get on the boat, Qiwen.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.380
Come on.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.339
The boat is full!

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:09.800
The boat can't take more!

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:11.859
No room left!

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:13.920
The child hasn't gotten on board yet!

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:14.619
Only two left!

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:15.560
Get on our boat!

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.180
-Get on this boat!
-Let the kids board!

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.619
-Get on this boat!
-Move closer!

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:19.450
Qiwen.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.910
I'll take Zai to that boat.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:21.450
Come closer!

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:22.339
Your ship is sinking!

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:23.210
There's still space on this boat!

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.619
Come closer! Come closer!

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:25.140
Hurry!

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.210
Be careful.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:41.660
Here.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.010
Daddy,

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.400
who were the people that rescued us
just now?

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.300
They're Communists—

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.420
members of
the Zhongshan Anti-Japanese Guerrillas.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:12.980
Thank you.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:15.770
Here.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.140
Where's Daddy?

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:25.820
Xian!

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:28.930
Dad!

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.050
Xian!

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:32.860
Xian!

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:34.820
-Mommy!
-Zai.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.790
Here, Xian!

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.860
Mommy!

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:52.690
-Zai.
-Grandpa.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:53.140
Dad.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:53.860
Zai.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:54.690
Are you alright?

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:55.450
Are you okay?

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:58.770
Be careful.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:00.140
Be careful.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:00.940
Comrade Ke,

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.050
we're counting on you
for what happens next.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.900
We still have to search for
other missing comrades,

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.560
so we'll take our leave first.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.420
Is there any hope that Commander Qu
and the others

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.930
are still alive?

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:24.660
Captain Long.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:26.970
Take care.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.140
Take care.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.880
Consul Fukue,

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.490
Portugus is a neutral country.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.820
The Hong Kong fugitive you mentioned

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.580
has not violated any laws of Macau.

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:40.970
What obligation
does the Macau government have

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.230
to assist in apprehending the fugitive?

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.550
-Here's the thing.
-We have...

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.530
shown Portugal the utmost respect.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.820
However, if you

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.820
disregard our request
and allow refugees to enter,

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.450
we will have no choice

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.350
but to regard the Macau government

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.940
as deliberately
violating the principle of neutrality

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.820
and aiding fugitives in their escape.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:01.820
In that event,

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.580
the 100,000 Imperial Army of Japan nearby

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:08.740
will have no choice but to intervene
and enforce order in Macau.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.730
What kind of people are the fugitives?

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.420
Can you provide us with a complete list

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.340
and their criminal evidence?

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.050
The detailed fugitive list and information

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.580
are currently under verification
by Hong Kong authorities.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.660
It will be provided once confirmed.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:28.460
If you cannot even clearly state
who the fugitives are

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.380
or what crimes they have committed,

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.140
how can we possibly
cooperate with the arrest?

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.490
The identification
and capture of the fugitives

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.420
will be handled by the Sawa Agency.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.550
There is no need
for the Macau government to intervene.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.490
Your only responsibility

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.580
is to ensure that

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.130
not a single refugee enters
the border without authorization.

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.730
Even if we are to close the border gate,

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.640
you must give us a time limit.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.210

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.970

I am Macau's Inspector General, Gonçalves.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.000
I now announce
an emergency government decree.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.500
Effective immediately,

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.740

Effective immediately,

to cross the border into Macau.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.130
what is going on?

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.580
By what authority
are you closing the border gate?

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.730
The temporary closure of Macau Customs

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.620
is a demand of the Empire of Japan.

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:54.210

By order of the Macau government,

the entry checkpoint
at the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal

It will reopen at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.240
What did you mean by that earlier?

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.960
Why not utilize the strength
of the Portuguese Macau government

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.920
instead of pursuing the fugitives
independently?

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.850
Can you trust such an important case

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:39.480
to the Portuguese Macau government?

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.440
If the fugitives escape,

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.060
who will take responsibility?

You?

However,

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.110
with the limited manpower
of the Sawa Agency,

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.070
how do you plan to capture them?

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.460
It is true that
the Sawa Agency's current manpower

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:57.920
is insufficient.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.850
But it doesn't matter,

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.790
because the manpower

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.580
is already delivering itself to us.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:08.380
Three days.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.730
Just give me three days,

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.520

Tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock,

Look, so many people here
haven't eaten anything either.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.030

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.390

Zai, Little Miss.

Where did you get the apple?

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:21.770
I bought it specifically for the children
when I went home.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:22.730
After all the trouble on the way,

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:23.870

Yu, help me get your mum up.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.590
How is Yu's mom?

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.590
Actually, the penetrating wound on her leg

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:57.720
isn't very serious,

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.630
but now the gate is closed
and she can't go to the hospital.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.350
The wound could get infected at any time.

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.110
Plus, she's lost a lot of blood

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:04.590
and hasn't eaten
or drunk anything for so long.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.130
Not to mention an injured person,

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.110
even a healthy person
couldn't endure this.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.040
Injuries and blood loss
make people extremely weak.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.570
The key is to eat something.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:13.800
But where can we get food right now?

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:15.110
That's true.

Hurry and give it to your mom to eat.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.000
But what about you?

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.440
We've eaten.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.490
Isn't that right, Little Miss?

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.510
Yes, we've eaten.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.410
Give it to your mom to eat.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000

you and your parents

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:53.830
are our saviors.

Don't worry.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.680
We will take care of your mother's injury
until she recovers.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.760
And Grandpa, Mommy,

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.240
me and Little Miss
will take good care of her.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.170
Comrade Ke,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.110
the food we brought is almost gone.

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.240
The younger ones might be able
to hold on a bit longer,

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.070
but the elderly...

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.360
What I'm worried about now isn't that.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.350
These gentlemen are really too old,

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.440
and they have to stay in this huge crowd

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.630
for a whole day.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.680
There may be a problem at any time.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:39.390
I wonder if Comrade Buddha's Hand

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:40.790
has received the message

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.200
and knows about our current situation.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:52.310
I was wondering why Mrs. Qiao was alone.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.830
It turns out Mr. Qiao...

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.680
Don't worry.

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:01.150
Mr. Qiao only works at a bank.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.070
He is neither British,

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.110
nor is he military, police,
or an official.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.770
The Japanese probably
won't do anything to him.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:16.510
I just don't understand.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.650
What could be so important that

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.060
he would disregard his own safety

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.600
and keep delaying like this?

[recorded its lowest temperature
since records began.]

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:52.180
[Frost covered the entire region
by midnight,]

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.090
[and countless people suffered from
frostbite and cold-related illnesses.]

[White Dove Scripture]

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.830
The first group of targets
departed Hong Kong last night

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.560
and are expected
to arrive in Macau this morning.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.790
Hello, I'm He Xian.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:16.960
I'm Ke Zhengping.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:18.770
Thank you for last night.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.630
If it had not been for
your boat coming to our rescue,

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:23.790
my son and I would still be in the sea.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:25.080
You're welcome.

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.550
This is the eighth one tonight, right?

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.200
The ninth.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:01.630
By tomorrow morning,

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.690
who knows how many more there will be.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:05.630
Daddy,

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.310
why are we being kept here?

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.590
Even if we're injured

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:10.840
or sick,

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.240
we can't enter Macau to see a doctor.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.590
Is Macau not part of China?

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.630
Child,

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:18.440
of course Macau

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.150
belongs to us Chinese.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.000
However, our government at that time
was weak and incompetent,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.970
allowing bandits to seize Macau

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.910
from our grasp.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:30.280
That's why

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.920
they dare to blatantly

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.280
shut us Chinese

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.830
out.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.830
Not just Macau,

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:39.100
but six other territories as well—

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.200
all occupied by bandits.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:43.630
I have a poet friend

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:44.720
named Wen Yiduo,

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.920
who wrote a series of poems

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.520
called

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.400
"Song of the Seven Sons".

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.680
It's to remind every Chinese person of

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.680
these seven children
separated from our motherland.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:58.070
The first poem is about Macau.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.440
Would you like to hear it?

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.000
Yes.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:03.760
Do you know that

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.150
"Mom Kong"

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.870
is not my true name?

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.000
I have been away from your cradle

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.830
for far too long.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.630
Mother.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.200
But though they have taken my body
by force,

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.720
you still hold

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.590
my inner soul.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.110
Mommy!

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.950
For 300 years,

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:42.180
I have never ceased dreaming of you,
my birth mother.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:49.720
Please call me by my childhood name.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.920
Call me

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:52.980
"Macau".

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.740
Mother.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.860
I want to come back.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:03.550
Mother.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.110
Reporting, Chief!

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.240
Every one of my men here

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.500
is a seasoned veteran of the underworld!

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:29.520
Do you find them satisfactory?

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:32.870
Dispatch all ambulances to the pier.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:34.540
Additionally,
have the medical team prepare

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.480
extra surgical masks
and armbands as backups.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.520
I'm concerned
there may be too many patients,

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.280
and we will need
to recruit volunteers on-site to assist.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.880
Alright, see you at the pier.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.350
These are

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:45.430
the fugitive photos
just delivered from Hong Kong.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.280
There are 10 copies in total.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:49.310
You have 20 minutes

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:51.040
to distribute them to your men.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:52.870
Divide them into groups of three,

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.240
issue one copy to each group,

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.000
and make sure they memorize
these individuals' appearances.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.730
Understood.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:57.480
Go.

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.850
The border gate will open in half an hour.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.680
Even if we gather enough manpower,

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.540
it will be impossible to screen
tens of thousands of refugees in time.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.680
Who said the gate would open at 9 o'clock?

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.280
Are you going to go back on your word

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.960
with Governor De Solaire?

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.680
You're right.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:36.870
Then what do you plan to do?

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.280
I've prepared bait for them—

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.440
special passes.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.150
Without employing some tactics,

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.990
how can we make the fugitives
reveal themselves?

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.990
Go and see De Solaire.

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:02.150
The above covers

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:03.720
the implementation
of the grain supply sources

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.520
and Hengfengyu's grain procurement plan.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.240
That concludes my introduction.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.190
Your Excellency the Governor,

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:11.040
our Chinese community has fulfilled
its commitment

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.320
and prepared a solution
to the food problem.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.440
The government should be able
to set aside its concerns

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.570
and open the gate as scheduled, right?

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.920
Inspector General Gonçalves,

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.120
what's your opinion?

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:23.320
The plan is detailed and thorough.
I have nothing to say.

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:24.420
In that case,

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.810
now,

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.840
as the Governor of Macau,

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:28.960
I hereby announce...

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.440
Wait.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.010
What?

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.980
It was agreed for 24 hours.

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:40.010
How can they break their promise?

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.710
Sawa Eisaku said

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:44.710
he only mentioned closing the gate
for 24 hours initially,

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:47.150
not that it would remain closed
for only 24 hours.

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:49.320
He has just received
the fugitive information

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:52.120
and needs more time
for screening and apprehending.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.650
He will come to Government House
immediately

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:56.040
to coordinate
specific apprehension matters with us.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.710
How can they do this?

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:58.840
This is outrageous.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:10.720
[Kiang Wu]

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:13.150
Mr. He, Ms. Qiao,

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.440
many doctors have arrived.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.750
My mommy will be saved!

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:28.550
It's already 9:05.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.280
Why hasn't the gate opened yet?

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:42.550
Your Excellency the Governor,

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:44.230
we Chinese merchants
have clearly presented

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:45.960
a solution to the food problem.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.880
If the government fails
to open the gate on schedule,

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.190
that would be a blatant breach of promise.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.960
Exactly.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.710
If the government concedes again,

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:54.000
how can we account
to all sectors of Macau,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.960
to various countries,

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.620
and to the entire international community?

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:59.270
But if the Japanese
really take military action

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:01.210
and confrontation
ensues between both sides,

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:02.940
who can bear the consequences?

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.360
As this concerns the future and destiny
of Macau,

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.380
it should be decided by a vote

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.400
of all members of the Executive Council.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.960
All members in favor of opening the gate
immediately,

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.920
please raise your hand now.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.400
Six votes.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:18.690
Wait.

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:22.440
Mr. Ma is just a member
of the General Chamber of Commerce,

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.880
not a formal member
of the Executive Council.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.610
He doesn't have voting rights.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.930
Five votes in favor.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.870
Good.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.150
All members
opposing the opening of the floodgates,

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:34.750
please raise your hands now.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.540
One, two, three, four…

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.590
Also five votes.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.660
Rodrigues, why didn't you vote?

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:42.880
Are you abstaining?

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.520
No.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.600
I want to vote.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.340
It's now five to five. Mr. Rodrigues,

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:50.700
your vote will decide the outcome.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.270
Please vote.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:53.750
I

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.370
am absolutely against opening the gates.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.620
Mr. Rodrigues.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:04.080
Why?

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.460
May I ask—

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.800
opening the gates is based on the premise

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.590
that you Chinese merchants promise to

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:11.630
solve the food shortage

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:13.360
caused by the influx of refugees.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.230
Is that correct?

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:15.230
Yes.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.040
Which is exactly why I voted against it.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:20.710
Because I don't believe in promises
made by you Chinese.

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:21.510
As for why,

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:23.300
perhaps you should ask Mr. Ma Wanqi

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.400
in charge of the proposal.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.320
Mr. Rodrigues,

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.550
you know very well there was a reason
behind that payment delay.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.960
I promised you

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.660
no matter what,

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.550
I will pay you back in full.

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:33.480
But since facts have proven

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.070
that promises made by you Chinese
simply can't be trusted,

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:37.630
I must put first

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:40.800
the survival of the hundreds
of thousands of people in Macau.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.440
I,

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.040
Rodrigues,

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.250
as a member
of the Macau Executive Council,

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.170
absolutely oppose opening the gates.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.750
Attention, please.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.210
Emergency announcement.

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:54.110
Attention, please.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:56.400
Emergency announcement.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.660
The Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal,

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.270
which was scheduled to
reopen at 9 a.m. today,

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:00.480
will remain closed

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.260
until further notice.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.520
The exact reopening time
is yet to be determined.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.400
-All passengers, please remain calm.
-Officer, please open the gate.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.520
My mother's hurt.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.710
If you don't open the gate now,
it'll be too late!

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:10.920
The Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal,

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.550
which was scheduled to
reopen at nine this morning,

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.840
will remain closed

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.400
until further notice.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.840
Let us in!

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.750
Protest! Protest! Protest!

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.040
The situation inside the gate
is extremely dire.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.360
From yesterday till now, dozens of bodies

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.550
have already been carried out,

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:29.650
and the number is still rising.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.270
It's as if the dead

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:35.330
weren't your Portuguese people, right?

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:35.920
But

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:38.920
even if you don't care about
Chinese lives,

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.520
there are still
many foreign nationals inside.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.440
And we

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.880
have already given solemn assurances
to the consuls of various countries

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.800
that the gate will reopen on time.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:49.440
If this continues,

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:51.270
the government won't be able to withstand

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:54.870
the immense pressure from
the entire international community.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.630
As for the pressure Governor is now under,

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:02.630
the Imperial Japanese Army understands it
very well.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:04.230
So

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.710
I came here specially

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:09.360
to offer you a good way

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.960
to ease that pressure.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.400
Protest! Protest!

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.230
To relieve the pressure inside the gate,

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:21.070
-the Macau government will issue
a batch of temporary special passes
-I have to go to see.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:23.920
for certain designated travelers.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.440
These passes will be
the only valid documents

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.320
for crossing the gate
before the official reopening.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.480
Quantities are limited.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.550
All foreign representatives,
after hearing this announcement,

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:35.750
please go to the
Port Authority Dispatch Center to apply.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.880
Repeating:

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.710
To ease the situation inside,

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.230
the Macau government will issue
a batch of temporary special passes

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:42.440
for special tourists.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:46.320
Per the Governor's agreement
with the Japanese side,

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:48.590
the issuance of these passes

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:50.170
will be carried out with your cooperation,

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:51.920
and all parties

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.520
must maintain proper order.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:54.920
Only 30 passes?

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.040
Mr. Lok Pak,

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.840
look outside the gate.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.800
How many foreigners
are among those refugees?

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.190
Ninety-nine percent are Chinese,

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:05.620
yet a handful of foreigners
took 70 passes.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.270
What about the
tens of thousands of Chinese?

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:08.360
How is that fair?

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.710
The Governor only cares about

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:11.070
pressure from foreign nations,

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:13.040
not Chinese refugees.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.720
If I hadn't fought for it,

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.400
these 30 passes

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:23.050
wouldn't even reach the Chinese community.

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:25.320
Figure out

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.400
how to distribute them.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.710
But

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:30.770
I have one request—

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.440
save one pass

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.440
for Miss Qiao Yinwan.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.300
Mr. Yamaguchi,

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.400
everyone's here.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.110
Announce the mission.

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:44.520
Yes.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.040
Listen carefully.

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:55.400
I'll be at the gate

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.530
watching those who pick up the passes.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.880
You

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.230
go in groups of three

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:02.040
and check the refugees.

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.360
This is our Special Service Division's

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.520
first mission—

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.880
and it must make an impact.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.270
Any fugitive

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:11.320
the Imperial Army wants—

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.880
not a single one is to slip through.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.520
Understood?

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.360
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.770
Did you take the photos?

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.570
Yes.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.040
Yes.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.520
While you still can,

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.630
take a look.

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:22.740
Take a good look at them.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.660
Memorize these faces.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:27.710
What?

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.230
Only 30 passes?

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.960
Look at

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:35.680
the lists submitted by all the groups—

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.530
there are over a hundred names.

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:38.800
They're all either

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.550
scientists

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:40.320
or

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.110
-educators.
-President Gao,
let's not get into that now.

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:43.840
Give it to me.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.320
Look at my list.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.930
You must get these people through.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:53.110
Every one of them is important.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:54.520
Mr. Liang,

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.460
you don't have to say more.

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:58.360
I'll put this list

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.270
at the very top.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.070
Thank you.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.500
What are you doing?

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:10.960
I'm Ke Lin,

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.750
leader of the volunteer medical team
from Kiang Wu Hospital.

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:12.750
I'm going in to provide emergency aid

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:14.750
to the refugees inside.

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:15.400
Please let me pass.

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.630
Sorry. Under the order,

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:17.710
once you enter,

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:18.630
you can't come out.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:19.320
I know.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:20.820
Please.

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:38.520
Guys,

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:40.760
I'm Ke Lin,
Director of the Medical Department

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.190
at Macau's Kiang Wu Hospital.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:43.400
From now on,

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.230
our medical team
will provide free treatment

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.400
-to help the refugees
-Ke Lin.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.370
in the gate.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.190
Severe and critical cases
will be treated first.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:52.990
If you need medical assistance,

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.190
please line up over there.

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:55.550
Good!

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:58.880
Zhang, you handle the initial check.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.190
Sort patients by severity—

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:01.270
critical cases first.

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.920
Okay.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.480
Ke Lin.
