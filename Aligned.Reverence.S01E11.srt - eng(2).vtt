(Propriety between uncle and sister-in-law)

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:48.979
Swallow it.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.340
It is an antidote.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.580
Yunxi.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.780
So it really is you.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.250
Since you are still alive,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.860
why not return home?

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.580
One in the light and one in the shadows,
only then can we act freely.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.660
Until the Linchuan case is cleared,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.260
I must remain a dead man to the world.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.980
Go back.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.699
Do not let Grandmother

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.500
and Mother worry.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.260
What about her?

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.420
Should I tell Sister-in-law

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.740
that you are alive?

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.340
No need.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.100
Vengeance is not yet taken.

00:02:54.637 --> 00:02:56.037
How can there be room for affection?

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.940
Go.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.299
Someone come quickly.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.620
Sixth Young Master fainted
the moment he entered the manor.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.660
It is fine.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.060
He pulled through.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.739
He took the antidote beforehand.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.460
He is in no real danger now.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.040
But he will likely run a fever
as the poison disperses tonight.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.670
Keep a close watch on him.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.020
Thank you, Physician Xi.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.460
Little lady,

00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:37.019
you had better

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.860
take good care of him.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.460
He is weaker than
a young girl half the time.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.420
Disturbing others in the dead of night.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.380
Yunxi.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.340
Danger.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.020
Why?

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.740
Why is it her?

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.580
Why Jinyuan?

00:04:25.562 --> 00:04:26.857
Yuan.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.020
Yuan.

00:04:33.075 --> 00:04:34.195
Yuan.

00:04:34.525 --> 00:04:36.285
Yuan, do not go.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.460
Do not leave.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:40.607
Yuan.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.780
Yuan, please do not go.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.020
I am hurt.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.580
Young Master.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.219
Last night,

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.739
Young Madam watched over you until dawn.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.379
She prepared
this calming incense for you,

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.620
so you may rest well.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.260
Thank you to her.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.460
But I slept quite well.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.820
Slept well?

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.380
Young Master, you...

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.074
You should

00:05:32.075 --> 00:05:33.580
fix your sleep-talking habit.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.780
Sleep-talking?

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.842
What did I say?

00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:43.407
How could you call Young Madam
by her given name?

00:05:44.162 --> 00:05:45.002
I...

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.740
What did I call her?

00:05:46.962 --> 00:05:48.002
How did I call her?

00:05:48.162 --> 00:05:49.357
You called her...

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.299
Yuan.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.019
Do not go.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.739
Yuan.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.140
I am hurt.

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:55.222
She heard everything?

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.780
This...

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.660
Yan.

00:06:24.537 --> 00:06:25.497
Well...

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.120
I am preparing the hundred-day memorial
for Father and Brother.

00:06:28.337 --> 00:06:30.845
I will go to Puji Temple
to pray for them.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.245
I need you to write a memorial eulogy.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.460
Alright.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.011
I...

00:06:47.012 --> 00:06:47.859
I will write it now.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.619
I will write it.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.582
I will write it.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.619
Young Madam.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.740
Give it to me.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.845
I will go to the storehouse
and prepare the offerings list.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.499
The storehouse

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.100
is not even in that direction.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.520
(May my brother, Xiao)

00:07:29.912 --> 00:07:32.170
(Xiao Yunxi)

00:07:35.275 --> 00:07:37.970
(May my brother, Xiao Yunxi)

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.660
Yunxi.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.945
(Xiao Yunxi)

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.220
(Xie Yunyan.)

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.460
(How could you have such thoughts?)

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.259
(What you should do)

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.660
(is uncover the truth.)

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.780
Young Master.

00:08:12.812 --> 00:08:13.945
The eulogy is finished?

00:08:14.075 --> 00:08:15.075
It is done.

00:08:15.075 --> 00:08:16.880
Ready the horses.
We are going to the garrison.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:17.939
Young Master,

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.940
shouldn't the eulogy
be given to Young Madam?

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.060
You give it to her.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.745
Young Master,

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.030
is he avoiding Young Madam?

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.180
(Grandmother said,)

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.860
(girls)

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.580
(should be cherished and cared for.)

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.180
When I restore Xiao Manor one day,

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.979
I will let all of you

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.260
be cherished like that.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.300
Yuan.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.810
Mother.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.259
Yan's appointment as Captain

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.740
was thanks to your efforts.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.740
This bracelet

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.100
was meant for Yunxi's wife.

00:09:20.112 --> 00:09:21.232
Put it on.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.782
It suits you well.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.500
Wear it when you go pray

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.220
the day after tomorrow.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.340
Yunxi will be pleased to see it.

00:09:39.075 --> 00:09:40.755
I will return first.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.460
Yan.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.780
And that one.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.380
Take another bundle of incense.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.780
Thank you.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.700
Is that not the widow
from Xiao Manor going to pay respects?

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.219
She will not even acknowledge
her own relatives,

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.659
yet she weeps so earnestly

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.860
at someone else's grave.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.699
You

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.380
call yourselves family?

00:11:27.177 --> 00:11:28.536
Not quite as eager as you were

00:11:28.537 --> 00:11:30.049
when scheming to take another's place

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.330
and marry into the Xiao family,

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.686
though neither my husband
nor Sixth Brother

00:11:34.687 --> 00:11:36.247
ever wanted you.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.580
Su Jinyuan,

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.339
if you had not interfered,

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.260
Xie Yunyan would already be mine.

00:11:43.412 --> 00:11:44.786
Daydreaming

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:46.507
under the sun again?

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.380
Xing'er, let us go.

00:11:56.325 --> 00:11:58.205
Did I not warn you

00:11:58.562 --> 00:12:00.642
to stay away from the Xiao family?

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.450
But I like you.

00:12:08.775 --> 00:12:11.095
She humiliated me first.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.036
She is only your sister-in-law.

00:12:15.037 --> 00:12:17.037
Why should she keep you close like that?

00:12:19.212 --> 00:12:20.852
Mind your words.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:22.619
We are in public.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.907
Control yourself.

00:12:41.737 --> 00:12:43.259
See that?

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.420
Young Master Xie blushed just now.

00:12:45.637 --> 00:12:47.677
It means he still has feelings for me.

00:12:48.537 --> 00:12:49.659
You should just stay put

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.979
and be the Xiao family's widow.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.300
Stop longing for your brother-in-law.

00:12:55.912 --> 00:12:58.886
Young Master Xie, your Sixth Brother,

00:12:58.887 --> 00:13:00.847
I will have him one day.

00:13:03.112 --> 00:13:04.232
Return to the manor.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.020
Where is she going to perform the rites?

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.140
I heard Puji Temple.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.900
Xiao Yunxi.

00:13:38.412 --> 00:13:39.892
Does it look nice?

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.450
What looks nice?

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.940
The scenery.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.540
The Xiao family is going
to Puji Temple today for blessings.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.432
So,

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.380
are you going?

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.300
Physician Xi.

00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:18.215
I need to trouble you with something.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.300
I cannot meet Yan openly.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.100
Please let him know for me.

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:23.932
Someone is watching him.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.220
I am a physician.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.980
Look at what I
have to deal with every day.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.940
I... Finally dressed like a lady once,
and now I have to change back.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.820
Thank you for this, Young Lady Xi.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.140
I know.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.860
How time flies.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.540
It is the Ghost Festival again.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.049
Indeed. Last year we prayed
and set river lanterns,

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:03.286
it feels like just yesterday.

00:15:03.287 --> 00:15:04.179
(Imperial Commissioned Puji Temple)

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.139
There may be fewer of us this year,

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.980
but the spirits will still bless the Xiao family.
