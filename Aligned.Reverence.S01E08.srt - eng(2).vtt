00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.460
So you want to die as well?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.357
What do you think you're doing?

00:01:24.447 --> 00:01:25.974
Aren't you afraid we'll report you?

00:01:25.975 --> 00:01:27.095
Go on then.

00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:29.405
If I die,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.330
I'll make sure your whole family
goes down with me.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.886
Right now,

00:01:37.887 --> 00:01:39.287
get out of Xiao Manor.

00:01:39.825 --> 00:01:40.785
Out.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.740
You dare cause trouble here,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.019
in the Xiao household?

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.320
What is it you want?

00:02:18.687 --> 00:02:20.167
Get out. Now.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.282
Xie Yunyan.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.749
One day you'll see

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.995
who she really is.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.024
You're still injured.

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:38.145
Don't get worked up.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.520
Let me take you back to rest.

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:42.682
All right.

00:02:46.712 --> 00:02:49.957
(Three days later)

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.100
Come here.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.140
Mother.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.020
Kneel.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.540
Mother.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.980
Did I do something wrong?

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.220
Take a good look at this.

00:03:32.987 --> 00:03:34.827
It's all over the streets and alleys.

00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:37.200
(Scandal claims the Xiao family)
It's bad enough they mock the Xiao family

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.615
(murdered and stole a bride)
for the broken betrothal,

00:03:39.412 --> 00:03:40.932
now they even accuse us

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:42.336
of killing your lover

00:03:42.337 --> 00:03:43.977
and stealing his wife.

00:03:44.162 --> 00:03:45.179
Mother.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.011
The Su family is slinging mud at us.
I'll confront them right away.

00:03:48.012 --> 00:03:49.020
Stay on your knees.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.232
Do you think you can explain this away?

00:03:52.412 --> 00:03:54.452
Do you want the Xiao family
shamed even more?

00:03:54.712 --> 00:03:55.336
But...

00:03:55.337 --> 00:03:56.777
But what?

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.500
In the end,

00:03:58.667 --> 00:03:59.786
it is your conduct in question

00:03:59.787 --> 00:04:01.787
that brings trouble to our door.

00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:07.685
My poor Yunxi…

00:04:07.862 --> 00:04:09.882
Even in death his name
is dragged through the mud.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.000
Do not worry, Mother.

00:04:14.325 --> 00:04:16.325
I will settle this.

00:04:17.262 --> 00:04:18.542
If I fail,

00:04:19.712 --> 00:04:21.912
I will leave the Xiao family myself.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.140
Mother was

00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:55.665
only speaking in anger.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.020
I know.

00:04:59.287 --> 00:05:00.967
The Su family is targeting me.

00:05:01.975 --> 00:05:03.295
Even so,

00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:04.957
I will not sit here

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.060
and let them smear the Xiao name.

00:05:09.412 --> 00:05:10.612
Do not worry.

00:05:11.137 --> 00:05:13.497
I will clear this up.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.790
If worst comes to worst,

00:05:14.825 --> 00:05:16.385
I'll drag Lu Zhuo out

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.660
and face him in court.

00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:24.045
No need.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.140
I killed him.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.790
The day you came for me,

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.300
I killed him.

00:05:36.462 --> 00:05:38.942
I burned the body, nothing left to find.

00:05:40.475 --> 00:05:42.715
The Su family
wants to use this against me.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.700
But I refuse to bow.

00:05:45.475 --> 00:05:46.875
It was Lu Zhuo

00:05:47.062 --> 00:05:48.782
who tricked me and ruined me.

00:06:03.225 --> 00:06:04.999
He owed me his life.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
He deserved to die.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.580
It's only one less villain in the world.

00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:20.315
I've dealt with villains

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:21.692
far more than you ever have.

00:06:22.475 --> 00:06:23.755
Justice always comes around.

00:06:26.675 --> 00:06:28.075
You should smile.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.660
Xie Yunyan.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.140
Thank you.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:13.730
Physician Xi.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.999
Why is Yan

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.640
not recovering at all?

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.724
If you ask me,

00:07:21.725 --> 00:07:25.219
Young Master Xie is probably
heartsore and worn out.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.100
Maybe hoping someone
will look after him.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.532
Watch your tongue.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.849
Physician Xi.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.920
Is Yan running a fever?

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.340
His face is so red.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.660
Him?

00:07:42.687 --> 00:07:44.682
I bet he's thinking of someone.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.499
Stop spouting nonsense.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.260
What I mean is,

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.260
you're thinking of your dream girl.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.580
Otherwise why would
his face be red like that?

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.670
Good, no fever.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.340
Yan, do you like someone?

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.899
Don't listen to her babbling.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.832
I...

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.539
If you truly like someone,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.619
you must tell me.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.220
I will help you see if she's worthy.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.590
Rest and heal.

00:08:58.075 --> 00:08:59.555
Yan.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.020
Am I the one you dream of?

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.900
(Do you care for me?)

00:09:13.687 --> 00:09:14.927
(Yan.)

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.579
Yan.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.779
Are you awake?

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.300
It's time for your medicine.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.260
I am coming in.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.020
All right.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.460
Do not forget the medicine.

00:09:43.187 --> 00:09:44.987
Your wound hurts again?

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.507
No.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.390
No.

00:10:02.287 --> 00:10:03.927
Why are you staring like that?

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.060
Am I the one in your dreams?

00:10:17.012 --> 00:10:18.732
You must be fevered.

00:10:23.425 --> 00:10:25.145
What is wrong with you now?

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.100
Medicine making you delirious?

00:10:35.027 --> 00:10:36.186
Weren't you giving me medicine?

00:10:36.187 --> 00:10:37.547
Hand it to me.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.660
Here.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.020
Slow down.

00:10:54.712 --> 00:10:56.672
Have a candied plum
to ease the bitterness.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.540
It is my favorite. Try one.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.660
Should you not be busy?

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.845
Xiang Lei,
remember to change his dressing.

00:11:20.325 --> 00:11:21.645
Rest well and recover.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.219
Xiang Lei, take good care of him.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.819
I will be stepping out.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.940
Yes.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.620
Young Master.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.380
Leave that for now.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.179
Later,

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.740
come with me to see Heir Qi.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.870
Do not tell the Young Madam.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.980
The Young Madam
has just gone to see him herself.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.819
You in women's attire

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.820
is surprisingly refreshing.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.979
Young Lady Su is bold indeed.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.859
The whole city is talking

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.019
about the Xiao family
killing for love and stealing a wife.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.660
Yet you dares to step out and secretly meet me,
a man outside her household.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.259
I came to see you

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.019
for this very reason.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.432
I will take this before His Majesty
and wash away the slander.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.699
Young Lady Su,
you are fiercer than you look.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.619
Risking everything
just to keep your honor.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.180
I admire that.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.420
You misunderstand.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.240
When Su family made that scene,

00:12:37.325 --> 00:12:39.405
they humiliated more than me.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.260
They shamed the Xiao family,
already stripped of rank.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.340
I see.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.859
So what you want

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.020
is not merely to clear your name,

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.740
also get Yan

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.980
a position.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.580
Correct.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.336
Luo Yu is dead,

00:13:01.337 --> 00:13:04.017
yet traces of his crimes remain.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.380
Yan has long sought
to serve in the Garrison.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.660
When I present my petition,

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.780
I hope you will help open the path.

00:13:16.437 --> 00:13:18.707
(Rook)

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.199
I cannot meddle

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.661
in military affairs.

00:13:23.662 --> 00:13:25.745
(Rook)

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.539
If Yan joins the Garrison
and the Xiao family rises again,

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.220
would that not grant you
influence in the army?

00:13:46.637 --> 00:13:47.786
You impress me more

00:13:47.787 --> 00:13:48.936
each time.

00:13:48.937 --> 00:13:50.417
Do it.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.419
A Captain of the Garrison for Yan,

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.540
I will secure the post for you.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.500
Qi Sheng,

00:13:56.762 --> 00:13:57.739
this matter concerns me.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.700
Why are you doing it for her sake?

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:06.922
Yan.

00:14:07.087 --> 00:14:08.299
I intend

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.260
to work with the Xiao family.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.260
So speak with me,

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.140
and leave her out of this.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:18.700
Go.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.382
(Pawn. Chu River)

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.236
Once the pawn crosses the river,

00:14:34.237 --> 00:14:35.659
(Pawn. Chu River)

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.300
there is no turning back.

00:14:40.687 --> 00:14:43.620
(Pawn)

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.282
(Feiwan Pavilion)

00:14:52.702 --> 00:14:55.760
So entering the Garrison to investigate
is what you called planning ahead?

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.339
The Garrison matters

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.940
I will handle myself.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.970
The Xiao family still needs you here.

00:15:01.512 --> 00:15:03.072
Do not risk yourself again.

00:15:08.512 --> 00:15:09.552
Very well.

00:15:10.062 --> 00:15:11.382
I will listen to you.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.699
Physician Xi said

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.274
you need more bed rest.

00:15:15.275 --> 00:15:17.635
Lie down and sleep a while.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.461
It is too warm today.

00:15:28.462 --> 00:15:29.742
I cannot stand the heat.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.780
Fan me for a bit, will you?

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.380
Young Master Xiao,

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.100
you do know how to order people around.

00:15:38.285 --> 00:15:39.524
It is only early spring,

00:15:39.525 --> 00:15:41.205
and you want someone to fan you?

00:15:43.837 --> 00:15:45.316
What do you know?

00:15:45.317 --> 00:15:45.636
I…

00:15:45.637 --> 00:15:46.732
Fine.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.011
I will stay right here.

00:15:48.012 --> 00:15:49.311
Not going anywhere.

00:15:49.312 --> 00:15:51.672
I will have Xiang Lei
fetch a fan from storage.

00:16:07.587 --> 00:16:08.827
He fell asleep already?

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:09.980
Of course.

00:16:10.662 --> 00:16:12.822
I, Xi Junning, never fail.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.780
But you doing all this for the Xiao family,

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.100
is it really worth it?

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.940
Do not think too highly of me.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.961
Only if the Xiao family stands,

00:16:22.962 --> 00:16:24.220
do I stand with them.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.857
Is that not so?
