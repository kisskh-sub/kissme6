00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.970
[Episode 40]

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.289
The way of business

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.340
is the way to plan for a nation.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.170
We need to find ways to compete with them.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.560
It's best to go to their territory

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.479
to do business.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.950
Make the best use of people,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.610
and the best use of resources.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.910
Perhaps this is

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.210
the only way out for us.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.289
At least we won't remain like now,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.280
don't you think?

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.130
I can now

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.870
see

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.280
a vague path ahead.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.800
But I can't explain it clearly.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.600
Do you agree with me?

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.000
Partly right,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.120
and partly wrong.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.240
But regardless of right or wrong,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.570
I admire your ambition,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.800
junior.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.420
However,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.690
these things you want to do...

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.550
To be honest,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.610
I don't think the Qing Dynasty
can achieve them.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.750
It might be possible

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.910
a hundred years

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.630
later.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.710
But our generation

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.440
certainly won't live to see it.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.160
Alright.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.410
It's getting late,

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.690
I should head back.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.850
Let me tell you one last thing.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.200
Quit while you're ahead.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.430
We still have

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.400
many years as brothers ahead of us.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.930
Don't find yourself

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.290
sacrificing everything too soon.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.750
Ms. Su, you're truly fascinating.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.800
How did you know

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.120
I've been looking for you everywhere?

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.710
I couldn't help but know.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.470
Everyone in Shanghai is talking about

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.630
a wealthy Chinese merchant, Mr. Gu,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.079
who wants to do business abroad.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.800
Yes.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.070
I've prepared all the goods,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.000
but I need a ship.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.280
All merchant ships are British-owned now.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.400
I'm not qualified to rent one,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.960
and they wouldn't rent to me anyway.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.910
Then I suddenly remembered that

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.150
you have a military ship, Ms. Su.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.080
What makes you think
I would rent it to you?

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.710
I believe you

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.400
wouldn't stand by and watch

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.870
Li Qin become a traitor.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.470
Actually, I'm very curious.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.710
Ms. Su, you're friendly

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.840
with one person at one moment,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.300
and with another the next,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.070
like a chameleon.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.269
I wonder why.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.560
How long have you been curious?

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.850
I've always been curious.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.680
You must know

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.070
about my father, right?

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.870
His entire family was executed,

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.730
and his nine clans exterminated.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.510
Many royal relatives

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.680
were Catholics.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.770
My adoptive father was a Western bishop.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.310
Back then,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.630
I was sent to Hong Kong

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.230
with the help of his friends.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.560
Later, I was sent
to serve the Heavenly King.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.870
I contacted old acquaintances

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.000
and gathered military intelligence.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.370
Unfortunately, the Heavenly King failed

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.800
and destroyed years of foundation.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.120
Though the Heavenly Kingdom fell,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.000
my sworn enemies remain.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.560
The Qing Dynasty's days are numbered.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.680
At that time,

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.240
I secretly moved useful talents

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.300
out of the country.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.630
I don't know what the Qing Dynasty

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.750
will become.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.070
But whatever it becomes,

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.070
it will be better than what it is now.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.460
Let's talk about the ship.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.270
I do have

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.400
a ship at my disposal

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.670
that money can rent.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.760
A Portuguese gunboat

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.440
is big enough for your cargo.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.580
But the problem is,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.310
you're not qualified to rent it.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.200
Your goods

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.040
need to be officially handled

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.360
by a foreign merchant.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:51.600
He'll be the captain,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.460
and you'll be the Chinese master.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.020
But who are you planning to

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.510
sell the goods to in India?

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.000
What makes you think

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.830
I was going to sell

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:03.830
my goods in India?

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.390
The God of Wealth has connections with

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.750
some British merchants.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.310
He has already made arrangements for me.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.120
This time,

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:10.630
I want to break through

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.390
the East India Company's blockade

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.430
and sell our goods

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.630
directly to Britain.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.150
How unexpected.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.160
I'll arrange a meeting
with the captain tomorrow.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.720
Bring along

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.680
the British merchant receiving the goods
with you,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.880
and both parties can sign the contract.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.620
This might be the very first

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.940
contract in the world.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.470
The first one

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.750
that allows a Chinese merchant

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.070
to conduct overseas business

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.750
in his personal capacity.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.650
How remarkable.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.120
Ms. Su.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:54.600
Thank you.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.310
After the contract is signed,
I'll have to worry about

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.600

I miss our child.

Do you think

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.000
it's a son or a daughter?

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.830
Either a son

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.560
or a daughter is fine.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.100
What matters most is that
you and the baby are safe.

what the business orders are?

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.380
The business order is

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:21.790
what he means by...

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:22.930
Business order is just like

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.830
the order among Chinese officials.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.090
Lower officials obey higher officials,

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.270
higher officials obey the Emperor,

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.100
and the Emperor obeys Heaven.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.950
Look at that.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.160
Once he explains it like this,

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.720
we all understand.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:37.830
In our place,

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.030
we respect order.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.920
You see, he is protesting,

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.590
and we understand completely.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:43.110
We have already

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.590
sent the person you mentioned

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.590
to prison in the Far East.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.000
That does not matter!

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:52.780
Mr. Richard says

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:53.830
that's not important.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.000
The cargo ship in Shanghai

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:55.920
must be stopped

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.760
and the voyage must be canceled.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.110
As far as I know,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:02.930
our Qing Dynasty

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.270
didn't have any ships

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.540
sent out to sea.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.550
You've misunderstood.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:08.780
No, no, no.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.590
The denial is useless.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.200
The denial is useless.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.270
He demands

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.200
an equal commercial negotiation.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.800
That's not a nice way to put it.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.480
Aren't we

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.240
negotiating right now?

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.600
We understand your protest.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.400
I've arrested the man

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.610
and sent him to the Far East prison.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:35.750
But

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.120
as for your request to stop

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.400
that ship,

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.340
that's a

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.410
Portuguese warship.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.670
The British hired it.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.240
How could I possibly

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.010
have the authority to stop it?

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.390
You've come to the wrong person.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.310
Mr. Richard wants to know

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:56.830
if Gu Pingyuan

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.960
is really in prison.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.030
Of course he is.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.890
He's just been tortured.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.130
Alright, guards!

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.160
Take this gentleman

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:07.920
to the Far East

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.240
prison to have a look.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.960
He's taking us to see him in jail.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.060
Thank you.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:15.410
Thank you, Sir.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.550
He's here.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.590
Gu Pingyuan.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.350
Your property has been confiscated,

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.070
and you've been imprisoned.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.450
You're even worse off than I am.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.130
Look at those people you were loyal to.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.890
See how they're treating you now,

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.080
and how they're treating me.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.510
You are truly hilarious.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:12.640
Mr. Gu.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.720
Lord Gu.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.850
He represents the East India Company

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:18.840
to inform you.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.640
They want to negotiate with you

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.780
to purchase the goods from that ship.

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:26.480
The situation you're in now

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.280
is not in your best interest.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:29.880
Discussing these matters

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.920
is pointless now.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.310
Say something useful.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.310
There's no need

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:35.720
to discuss these questions.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.070
Say something useful.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.350
What do you want?

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.310
What do you want?

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.240
I've already paid the money.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.640
Within two days,

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.680
if you don't return
our salt fields' title deeds

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.880
exactly as they were,

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.020
that ship with the cargo

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.220
will sail on schedule.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.110
Damn it!

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.110
This is a trap set by

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:03.640
the Viceroy and you!

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.310
Mr. Hart.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.310
Mr. Richard.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.620
Have a seat.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.120
Mr. Hart.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.070
I heard that you're involved with my...

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.590
wager with

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.350
the Governor of Liangjiang.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.830
Wager? What Wager?

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.960
You mean the salt fields.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:30.510
Yes!

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.030
Indeed.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.240
You've been a little
hotheaded recently, huh?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Mr. Hart.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:38.960
I respect you

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.830
as a veteran in this business.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.640
But you must respect

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.110
the influence of the East

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.030
India Company here in China.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.030
In the dispute over a property mortgage,

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.820
the responsibility is quite clear.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.160
It is those Chinese officials

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.640
who are evading and denying.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.120
And I hope Mr. Hart

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.000
will objectively address that issue.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.890
I am employed by the Qing government

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.430
as the head of the Customs.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.840
I'm in charge of all
import and export businesses.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:21.790
I believe I have been very objective

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.070
in treating your company

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:25.070
and I've never meddled in the normal

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.730
business of your company.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.050
Now this accusation of yours...
Where does it come from?

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.310
This all

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:33.960
is a breach of agreements.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.790
We do not mind the competition.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.880
But if a Chinese merchant

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.350
will independently disobey

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.040
his government's law

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.790
and openly provoke us...

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.680
If it weren't for your connivance,

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.590
do you think he would have done it?

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
I understand.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.440
Now, I'd like to ask you.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.240
In all of this business,

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.680
what did I do?

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.060
Come on.

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:05.790
I thought you said you were

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:07.590
not afraid of some competition.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.650
We aren't afraid of the competition.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.480
There are many goods,

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.110
but they're not enough

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.360
to impact our company's market.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.590
But my friend,

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.720
this impacts you, huh?

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.160
What?

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.360
You little monkey,

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.630
think you're something special now?

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.960
Both my legs are bruised now.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.240
I had to use some force.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.480
That Richard

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.430
is complaining everywhere like a mad dog.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.990
If this matter succeeds,

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.860
I'll give you a big reward.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:03.720
Just let me go back to Anhui.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.720
I won't stay in Liangjiang for long.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.440
Liangjiang has recovered well
these past two years.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.350
Jiu has also

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:12.590
disbanded

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.650
most of his troops.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.410
A tiger without claws and teeth

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.920
is no longer a threat.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.960
The imperial court wants me back,

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.720
perhaps as a Grand Councillor,

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.730
or perhaps for nothing at all.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:27.000
The imperial court wants to establish
a Ministry of Commerce.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.590
They've decreed

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.270
that we senior officials
make recommendations.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:30.870
I think...

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:32.920
Look at you.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.790
You said it yourself.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.480
Business serves the nation.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.790
Aren't you more suited

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:39.640
for this position than

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.070
those officials who know nothing

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:42.000
about business?

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.410
If someone else got this job,

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.910
they'd wake up laughing from their dreams.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.960
When I think about it,

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.920
I've handled quite a lot of silver

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.790
in my lifetime.

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:58.310
But only when I was

00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:59.720
growing tea in Anhui,

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.700
did I feel most at peace

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:02.920
and happy.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.260
Business serving the nation is true,

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.680
but only if the nation can be served.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.510
Even with your position

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.170
as the Viceroy of Liangjiang,

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.480
you can't handle those foreign merchants.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.940
What makes you think I can?

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.830
We're considered friends,

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.720
so tell me the truth.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.070
I know

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.440
you used cash for all your purchases.

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:30.970
Where did the money come from?

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:32.240
You want to know?

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.000
I'm curious.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.310
The imperial court asked me
to report back carefully.

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.030
I certainly can't lie,

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:39.720
can I?

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.590
Minister of Commerce?

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.000
This is no gift.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.270
This is a death warrant.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.340
What's the use of wealth and status?

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.880
You're right.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.680
Just tell me.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.070
I believe Gu Pingyuan

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.110
has invested all his fortune

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:47.000
to make this happen.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.350
But the cargo of one ship,

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.750
no matter how much,

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:49.920
cannot possibly impact

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.030
the East India Company commercially.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.550
If you can persevere

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.400
and obtain the operating rights
to the Lianghuai salt industry,

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.930
do you know what that means?

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.110
You will get one-fifth

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.570
of the Qing Dynasty's official industries.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.510
Using this as a stepping stone,

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.030
you can acquire

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.290
immeasurable wealth.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:03.510
You must trust me.

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:04.480
This is the biggest threat

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.510
he could think of.

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.550
This isn't a business move.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:08.920
It's not even clever.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.510
This is a Chinese-style tactic.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.590
Li, do you know what you're saying?

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:17.270
I do.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.480
Rather than being manipulated
by bureaucrats,

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.750
I'd prefer fairness.

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.240
Between us,

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.380
fairness is not an option.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.210
You're just one person.

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:35.750
I have at least one ship.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:41.480
Please.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.480
Come, please.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.030
That merchant named Gu

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.490
has finally quieted down.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.680
The imperial court has severely

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.670
punished him.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:19.160
However, that shipment

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.350
was still handled by Mr. Hart

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.530
as an intermediary,

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:23.440
and eventually

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.400
sold to the East India Company.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.920
Xianghe Trade House

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.550
has achieved remarkable success.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.070
Congratulations indeed.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:44.070
Cunning.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.210
Cunning.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.110
Likewise.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.560
Well then.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.640
Alright.

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:56.730
Alright, gentlemen, look this way.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.680
-Ready.
-Three, two, one.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:08.850
Mr. Gu.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:13.680
Mr. Gu, congratulations!

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.840
Congratulations to you!

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.510
Mr. Gu.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.890
The salt field has been reclaimed.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.610
I'll ask you one last time.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.340
Where did the money come from?

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:32.070
Or else?

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:33.590
Or else,

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.200
you'll be sent to the capital in shackles.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.590
They'll have your head.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:41.720
Look.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.400
Is it sturdy?

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:44.520
It is sturdy.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:46.200
As for me,

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.070
I'm keeping my head to enjoy
a few more years of drinking.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.070
So I'm afraid you'll have to suffer.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:52.160
Guards!

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.350
Take him to the capital in shackles!

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.920
Yes, sir!

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.550
I just received orders
from the imperial court.

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:00.510
They're transferring me out of Liangjiang,

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:01.750
You won't be lonely

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.880
on your journey.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.680
We'll travel together.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:14.400
I was escorting the condemned official

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.600
and had just left Liangjiang territory

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.960
when the condemned official

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.909
died from a severe illness in prison.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:23.719
His body has been cremated,

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:27.750
and many witnesses can testify to this.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.630
During my post in Liangjiang,

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.190
I obtained
the condemned official's confession

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:35.360
and verified that

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:38.510
the so-called enormous payment

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:40.949
is merely gossip

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.360
and baseless rumors,

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:44.120
not worthy of credence.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.560
The condemned official is dead.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:48.000
I

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.070
was negligent in my supervision

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.130
and am willing to accept punishment.

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:54.489
That's enough.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.060
Let's leave it at that.

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.150
Go by land tomorrow

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.480
and send it to the imperial court
by horse.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.450
Sir.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.130
Is this sufficient?

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.070
Isn't this a bit absurd?

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:14.030
The imperial court
is desperately demanding money.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:16.080
Isn't that even more absurd?

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:43.920
Make no mistake.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.640
You're already dead.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:47.930
When Rui Lin handed you over to me,

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.420
you were already a corpse.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.680
Why is he here?

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.720
He requested it himself.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:10.280
I thought you'd be at the foreign firm,

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.320
hanging out with those foreigners.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.220
Whoever I associate with
is better than you.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.760
Everyone knows you're supposed to be dead.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.520
At least being dead means I won't
leave behind a shameful legacy.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:23.510
That's enough.

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.230
You brothers argue the moment you meet.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.360
Young Master Li came specially

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.360
to see you off.

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:29.420

Otherwise,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.200

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:33.920
Why leave?

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:34.670
Where to?

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.770
To see the world.

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:42.630
I've been under this sky

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:43.550
for too long.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.320
I want to see something new

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.760
and learn something new.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.840
If the chance arises,

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.410
I'll come back one day.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.100
Take care of yourself.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:18.440

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.240
I understand.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.150
I'll tend to

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.810
your parents' graves for you.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.590
I'll tell your father

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:25.650
where you've gone.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.510
Good.

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.170

I might take Yu'er

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.380
and travel around.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.200
Or maybe change your name

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.540
and continue doing business.

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:06.290
Right?

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.230
I just want my child to see me

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.550
as soon as they open their eyes.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:12.280
Nothing is more important

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.410
than that right now.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:16.230
Disheartened now?

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.710
Not really.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.250
I may not be an official,

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.110
but there's still work to be done.

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:23.250
I just hope that in the future,

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:23.880
everyone can

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.400

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.330

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:03.320
Hu.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.290
After this battle,

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.760
we've sacrificed blood for our homeland

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.620
and crushed our enemy's courage.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.710
The Qing court is conducting
massive arrests.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:15.280
I'm glad you and our comrades

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.890
escaped safely.

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.040
Now the Qing Dynasty is on its last legs,

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:23.000
and our Chinese nation

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:23.920
cannot stand among

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.380
the world's great powers.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.100
Only those with great ability

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:28.590
can change our fate.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:31.010
Our 400 million compatriots must

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:32.630
discard the old and embrace the new,

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.130
become self-reliant and independent.

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:35.110
Only then can we escape

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.570
the fate of being carved up
and slaughtered.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.440
If our divine land sinks,

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.480
and our civilization is lost,

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.810
even dying nine times would not redeem us.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.570
I heard you're raising funds
for the revolution.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.190
I've enclosed a check.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:50.600
If the revolution falters,

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:51.550
I will

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.280
provide full support.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:04.870
