In the name of Hole Ghost,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.160
you stole children

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.480

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.950

How did you do it?

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.390
Its flavor matched the taste

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.480
of the hallucinogenic spice you burned that day,

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.560
so I learned the drug content

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.430
and then configured the antidote.

Regarding the drums that are most important to your illusion,

you chose Wang Zhong, who was not skilled in this.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Afterwards, I asked Wang Bo to play the drums

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.900
in order to disrupt your drumming,

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.420
and thus,

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.000
your illusion failed.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.000

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.730
Time was too short.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.550
After I went up the mountain to save you

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.430
and get out,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.680
I ran into the border army on patrol.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.220
I thought it would take at least

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.550
a day to travel between the two places,

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.070

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.390
Get more if it's not enough.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:12.240
Why did you eat her share?

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:13.320
That's right.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:16.430
I know.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.560
It smells good.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:27.670
Yingying.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:28.800
Come, sit down.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.190
I'll bring you a bowl of broth.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.520
I didn't let you down and found the clue.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.080
Come on.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:42.240
Drink it while it's hot.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:47.110
You found out that Han Shuo's Water-shaped Jade

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:48.520
was given to him by Song Zhe.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.080
The Mountain-shaped Jade of Tianyi tribe was looted from Song Yuan.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.210
Song Zhe and Song Yuan

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.670
were soldiers who were raided back then.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:57.830
Right?

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.320
Let's talk about Song Jingye.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.630
He used to be the leader of the Royal Army.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:05.670
His Cloud-shaped Jade

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.190
and the Bird Jade Plate that was given to Physician Fu

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.320
were left behind

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.190
after the Raid.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.190
So you're saying

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.910
that the only reason

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.080
these jades are scattered

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.240
is because of the Raid,

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.830
which was caused by an accident?

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.720
That's right.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.350
Based on these clues,

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.670
Hearsay-capturing Pavilion found out

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.430
that there was indeed

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.040
a raid outside Xichuan.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.350
Who was responsible

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:34.110
for the Raid outside Xichuan?

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.720
Lord Wen.

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:38.000
My father?

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:41.590
How can that be?

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.180
It was rumored that a group of bandits

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:46.520
robbed the treasure.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.730
When Lord Wen received the news,

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:50.210
he sent his men to hunt them down,

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.960
but they didn't find the treasure,

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.590
so the matter was left unsettled.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
According to the time of the incident,

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:57.910
the bandit that was raided

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.720
was Song Jingye's Royal Army.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.080
Let's go.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:06.630
Go to my father and ask about it.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.300
[Lord's Mansion]

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:18.760
Jue.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.040
What are you...

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.350
I came

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.780
to ask about the Raid.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.040
Who did you hear that from?

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.150
Hearsay-capturing Pavilion?

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.200
They were right.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.350
I did raid a bandit back in the day.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.520
Father.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.300
Who gave you the message about the bandit?

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.070
It wasn't a message

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:50.580
but an order.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.840
Back then, we were coerced by the Jibei Mansion.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:56.870
They claimed

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.070
a bandit had stolen the treasure

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:01.280
and ordered me to raid them

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.150
to get it back.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.960
Xichuan was not affiliated with Jibei,

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.800
but Jibei was powerful,

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.440
so I had to obey them.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.960
Sir, they're here.

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:18.200
Pull.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:28.870
Charge.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.680
Something's wrong.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.000
This group follows orders,

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.310
acts decisively, and is organized,

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.310
not like bandits.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.920
I'm afraid there's a trap.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.150
On my mark.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:51.360
Split up into two groups

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:52.430
and break out on the left and right.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.070
- Yes, sir.- Yes.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.720
Charge.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.110
Boss, run.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:10.590
Run!

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.200
Take the men to go after

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.830
the ones who just escaped.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.390
As for the rest, I'll take care of them myself.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.070
Yes, sir.

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:26.110
Sir, something's wrong.

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.720
These bandits only want to run away, not to kill.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.280
They didn't kill us.

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.200
It seems I've been deceived by Mansion's men

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.480
and have done something terrible for them.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.590
Sir, what should we do?

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:38.780
Do we keep killing?

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:39.680
There's no way

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.960
we can stop now.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.240
Kill them as soon as possible.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.040
All of them.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.040
I later learned that the group

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.920
was not bandits at all

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:00.280
but the Royal Army.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.350
Lord Wen.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.070
I apologize for being offensive,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.960
but I'd like to ask a question.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.350
Go ahead.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:13.630
You only learned of it later,

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.550
so how did you learn of it?

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.310
Also, were there any of those bandits

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.520
back then who are still alive today?

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.520
Sir.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.710
Should we get a physician?

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.190
I'm afraid he won't last much longer.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:30.950
Take off his shirt.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.420
- Yes, sir.- Yes, sir.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:35.710
Strange.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:37.950
Why is a bandit wearing this thin armor?

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:38.720
Sir,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.440
this thin armor doesn't look normal.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.480
I'm afraid what you said earlier is true.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.390
Give him some normal clothes later.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.110
Yes, sir.

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:49.000
Sir.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.150
Who are these men?

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.950
When we fought, they were fierce and bold.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.590
They seemed to have had some kind of training.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.840
Listen up.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:57.080
Forget everything that happened today.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.670
Don't ask about what you shouldn't know.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.170
Yes, sir.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.320
I'm sorry for speaking out of turn.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.920
Burn his armor

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.020
and get a physician for him.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:05.490
Yes, sir.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:21.230
Stop.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.880
Do you know who this man is?

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.750
Let go.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:25.800
Lord Wen.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:26.640
Do you know me?

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.030
Since I wanted to pass through your territory,

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:32.440
of course I know you.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:35.830
Go away.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.070
Don't, sir.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:39.000
Don't worry.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:40.400
He can't hurt me.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:41.480
Go away.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:43.160
Yes, sir.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:01.640
You're tough.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.680
Now can you tell me

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.200
who you really are?

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.160
Let me rephrase the question.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.590
Are you

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.480
the Royal Army?

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.550
Lord Wen.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.200
You are merely a pawn being used.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.680
I need to advise you.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.790
If you want to live,

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.400
don't go any further.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:42.360
I knew then

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.920
that I had been unwittingly

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:48.510
drawn into the court's strife.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.400
To save the city,

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.310
I decided to change

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.510
the man's name to Meng Qin

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.160
and send him to a nearby theater

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.480
to remain anonymous.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.920
I pretended I'd never met the man,

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.440
and he didn't refuse.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.510
And?

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:08.790
What happened then?

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.760
In all these years,

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.510
I've never been to him.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.590
And I don't know if he's dead or alive now.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:17.720
Lord Wen.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.110
Did you know

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.440
that Song Jingye was the leader

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:22.310
of the Royal Army back then?

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:23.480
Him?

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.110
No wonder I heard that Song Jingye likes to watch theater.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.000
Looks like

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:35.310
he had gone and met him.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:37.640
The Royal Army that protected

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.550
the royal family was raided,

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.310
but the royal family

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.880
was the one giving the orders.

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:44.890
What's going on here?

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.530
Are they killing their own people?

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:48.200
There must be something

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.720
that no one should know about.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:51.750
Yes.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.560
I'm not sure about the political stuff either.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:56.160
Besides, I didn't talk much

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.740
to that man back then,

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:58.930
but

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:00.550
I do remember

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.270
he said

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.780
that it wasn't the royal family that ordered them

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:06.510
to be hunted down.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.810
It was

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.030
Breakwall.

Rhizoma gastrodiae is also known as Gastrodia.

Some call it Red Arrow

because of its reddish stem.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.100
A cupful of powder made from it every day

will make you agilely mobile and energetic.

is taken regularly to prolong life,

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.630
which is similar in appearance to rhizoma gastrodiae

but highly toxic.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.960
If you take it often, you will become addicted to it.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:18.790
he taught Meng Qin acrobatics

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.480
because he saw he knew martial arts.

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.880

Let's go check out the other acrobatics crews.

What they're saying sounds good,

like you're about to meet a god,

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.520

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.000
and will not receive any more guests.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.000
Chairman Sun.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.920
I'm probably not an outsider, am I?

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.750
I think you've got the wrong person.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.710
My parents came to Xichuan to dig for Star Gold

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.150
and settled here.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:45.310
I was born

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:47.360
and raised outside

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.040
of Xichuan.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.520
When I was eight, I learned shadow puppetry.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.520
To this day,

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:55.440
I have never been to another theater

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:57.110
or left Xichuan.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.270
These are your words.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.360
Who can prove it?

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.310
My father.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.270
When I was 25,

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:08.110
he contracted consumption

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.630
and died soon after.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.270
My mother was paralyzed

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:12.150
and died last year.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.630
My fellows helped me

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.270
with the funeral.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.750
They are buried together at the foot of the mountain outside the city.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.710
You'll see

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.710
when you get there.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.890
Mr. Meng was a filial son.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.840
He served his mother until she was 61.

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:25.960
In this place, that's a long life.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.710
Do you have anyone else at home?

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.310
I have only one wife and one son.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:32.670
My son is five years old.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.560
That's not quite right.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.750
You're quite old,

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.310
but why is your son

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:39.560
so young?

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:44.880
Our line of work

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:46.040
is despised.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:47.960
Marriage is not easy for us.

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:50.670
It seems the Meng Qin you're looking for

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.400
and I just have the same name.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:58.080
Mr. Meng, your hand...

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:00.480
Scalded by lime?

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.520
Each piece of cloth used for the show

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:07.270
is handpicked by me,

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.670
treated with lime,

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.040
and then washed and dried.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.360
I can't be sloppy.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.440
All the props here

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.040
are handmade by Mr. Meng.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.360
This is real craftsmanship.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.110
Not the slightest bit fake.

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:24.360
Mr. Meng,

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.150
do you know Song Jingye

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:28.440
of the Jibei Chamber of Commerce?

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.560
Chairman Song often comes to see the shadow puppet show,

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:34.750
and I've won many awards,

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.590
so I'm sure I know him.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.270
But

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.000
I'm so lowly that I didn't have a chance

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.230
to thank him in person.

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:43.840
Did Hearsay-capturing Pavilion get the wrong person?

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:46.670
Master.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.720
The leader asks you to prepare.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.360
There is a nobleman who wants to see Master Huang in the East Sea.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.550
You all seem

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:58.000
to be civilized

00:41:58.590 --> 00:41:59.750
and not here to trouble me.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:01.110
If there's nothing else,

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.670
I have to get ready for the show.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:04.590
Sorry to interrupt.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:06.270
Let's go.

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:31.080
Who's

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.270
the noble guest this time?

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:35.840
The new Chairman of the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.670
Jibei Chamber of Commerce?

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.520
The leader just had the gate closed

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.590
to keep us out of the way

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.630
in case we bumped into the guest.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.980
When everything is taken care of,

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:03.860
the Lord will lead the Jibei Army

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.530
to Xichuan.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:07.050
What?

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:08.380
Who's there?

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.600
[The animals in the show are props]

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.900
