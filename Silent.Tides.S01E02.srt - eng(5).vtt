[Episode 2]

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.150
[December 8, 1941, Macau]

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.680
The 20 barrels of gasoline
have been inspected.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.009
Load them onto the ship.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.229
Hold on, hold on.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.539
Everyone, wait.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.640
Stop loading.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.420
Mr. Rodrigues.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.120
Stop it.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.120
Halt the loading.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.680
Weren't you supposed to come at 8 o'clock

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.810
after our inspection
to collect the payment?

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.980
I just received an urgent telegram

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.110
[Rodrigues, Portuguese merchant in Macau]

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.430
from our American supplier.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.310
This shipment can no longer be paid
in Hong Kong dollars.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.280
It must be paid in US dollars only.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.910
What?

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.800
The Headquarters is considering

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.670
using Macau as a replacement
for Hong Kong.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.370
Once the Empire controls Hong Kong

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.800
or even the entire Southeast Asia,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.320
Macau

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.780
will become the only isolated island
in the South China Sea,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.460
or even in the entire Western Pacific,
surrounded by our imperial forces.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.690
Given Portugal's limited military presence
in Macau,

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.860
if we're
really going to implement an occupation,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.190
it will be child's play.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.340
Therefore,

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.410
whether to directly occupy Macau

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.800
or to keep things as they are for now,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.630
we will await

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.870
your professional advice on this issue.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.820
Mr. Rodrigues,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.440
you can't be so unreasonable.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.730
Transactions in Macau have always been

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.860
settled in Hong Kong dollars.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.100
In such a short time,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.620
[Ma Wanqi, owner of Hengfengyu Bank]

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.300
in such a tiny place like Macau,

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.970
where am I supposed to get you
this huge amount of US dollars?

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.410
Macau is indeed small,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.000
but

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.080
you can still find help from Hong Kong.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.150
But our ship must leave

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.270
before 8 AM.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.079
The banks and forex markets in Hong Kong

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.280
don't open until 9 AM.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:20.240
It is

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.090
impossible for us to make it!

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.740
In a nutshell,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.800
this deal will be canceled unless you

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.890
change the payment to US dollars.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.740
[Mr. Lin, Chinese merchant in Macau]

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.070
The only solution now is

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.579
to send a speedboat

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.210
to Hong Kong and have this payment

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.740
exchanged into US dollars.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.690
But the Hong Kong foreign exchange markets

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.620
only open at 9 AM.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.300
Such a large amount of US dollars

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.060
would take considerable time
just for the exchange.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.810
Even if we pull it off,

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.060
by the time we rush back to Macau,

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.720
it'll be too late, I'm afraid.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.310
Hello.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.700
This is He Xian.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.200
Mr. Lin?

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.030
All this money has to be

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.420
exchanged into US dollars today?

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.280
Not just today,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.100
but by noon today at the latest,

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.190
the exchanged US dollars must be

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.510
delivered back to Macau.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.510
Doesn't that mean

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.620
it must be exchanged before 8:30?

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.690
That's only 4 hours in total!

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.510
I know
this is almost like an impossible mission.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.820
No one else could do it.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.140
That's why I recommended you

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.000
to Mr. Ma Wanqi.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.930
Ma Wanqi?

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.080
You mean Mr. Ma, the owner of Hengfengyu?

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.580
Yes,

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.490
we're partners in this business.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.090
He's the major shareholder.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.190
Mr. Lin,

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.659
thank you for thinking of me

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.490
and bringing me such a big deal.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.580
But I

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.220
can't accept it.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.760
Xian,

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.590
please think twice about it.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.470
How about this?

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.210
Mr. Ma and I will pay you
double commission.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.360
It's not about the commission.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.630
Let me talk to him.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.510
Mr. He,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.760
I'm Ma Wanqi.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.130
Hello, Mr. Ma.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.370
Here's the thing.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.070
I know that Lin and I are being
quite presumptuous

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.310
to approach you like this.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.430
But I hope you can
hear me out before making

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.290
your decision.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.650
Please go ahead.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.340
Yesterday,
at the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal,

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.950
there was a fundraising performance
for national salvation.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.080
It was you who helped defeat
the Japanese Specie Bank

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.550
and won a large sum of money from them,

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.950
right?

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.660
I was just doing a favor

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.520
by the way.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.020
But this makes me believe

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.810
that you are a patriotic Chinese.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.220
That fundraising performance was

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.640
for the war supplies

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.370
that Lin and I were purchasing.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.500
These war supplies will exert

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.159
a direct influence
on the frontline situation.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.840
Lin and I finally gathered enough money

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.170
and secured those goods.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.870
They must be shipped

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.570
within a specific time today

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.510
to safely reach the rear areas.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.580
But the supplier suddenly changed his mind

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.840
and now demands payment in US dollars.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.780
In such a short time,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.450
we can't complete
such a large currency exchange.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.670
Now, the supplies might not only fail
to reach the frontline soldiers

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.080
but could even fall
into the hands of the Japanese

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.610
and become tools
for their invasion of China.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.280
I see now.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.580
Mr. He,

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.550
I know it's almost impossible for anyone

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.050
to complete this large currency exchange

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.400
in such a short time.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.050
We've never met before,

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.990
and I know my request is

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.960
too presumptuous.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.640
But...

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.450
Mr. Ma,

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.370
I can't

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.710
guarantee success,

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.250
but I can promise

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.290
that I'll do my absolute best.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.990
Within your specified time,

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.020
however much I can exchange,

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.070
that's what you'll get.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.550
Thank you, Mr. He.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.450
Thank you.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.130
There's one more thing.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.700
The Japanese are also
coveting these supplies

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.690
and will stop at nothing to get them.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.170
So please keep this under wraps

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.190
and don't reveal to anyone

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.820
the reason for this currency exchange.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.020
Please rest assured.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.930
I'll keep it confidential.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.200
Thank you, Mr. He.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.950
Xian.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.760
What business

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.670
got you in such a hurry?

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.080
It's still dark outside.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.580
Call Quan right now

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.760
and tell him to wait for me at Huilong.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.450
Okay.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.840
I'm leaving.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.340
Mm-hmm.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.110
Such a big order,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.460
and it's so urgent.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.780
Where did you receive it from?

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:56.400
Don't ask

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.430
about the client.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.220
I've promised to keep it secret.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.870
Lyu,

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.020
I promise you

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.840
that the client is
a legitimate businessman.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.450
They just had an emergency come up

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.870
and needed help urgently.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:06.400
Alright,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.950
since you're vouching for it,

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:08.840
I won't ask any more questions.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.460
Fine.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.790
What do you need from me?

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.170
How many US dollars
do you have in your account?

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.080
I need all of it.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.190
All of it?

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:14.750
Yes.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.190
Also, we've got way too many banks
on the Finance Street.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.820
I can't handle it all by myself.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.780
I have

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:21.070
a list here.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:21.900
Can you

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.630
help me visit a few of them?

I've contacted all the banks

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:33.670
Impossible.

How is it impossible?

The fact is clear.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.030

where's my money?

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.270
Mr. He, where are my US dollars?

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.200
Exchange our money back right now.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:57.500
Yeah!

Did you know about this in advance?

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.570
Know what in advance?

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.530
The war between America and Japan.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:18.500
Otherwise, why were you

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.120
in such a hurry
to exchange all the US dollars

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.050

to your fellows in this industry?

I've promised my client to keep it secret.

I can't tell you.

if I've caused any losses for anyone,

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:30.950

all transport links
between Hong Kong and Macau have been cut.

Even if those U.S. dollars
weren't destroyed in the attacks

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.150
and are kept intact now,
it's nearly impossible

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.210
to recover them before a cease-fire.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.110
I wish I had agreed to take
Hong Kong dollars.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.170
Mr. Rodrigues,

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.150
if what I think is correct,

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.330
the American suppliers didn't request

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:38.950
the payment currency
be changed to U.S. dollars.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:39.960
In fact, you learned about

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.670
this war before it happened.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.960
That was why you asked for U.S. dollars.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.560
Am I right?

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.910
What's the point of saying all this now?

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.110
Be it Hong Kong dollars or U.S. dollars,

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.410
now I only care about

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.830
what I have to do to get paid.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.440
I'm more concerned about

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.090
the dozens of cases
of precision instruments and medicine.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.950
You haven't paid a penny
for the previous shipment.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.040
And you're now asking for this new one?

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:05.760
I know

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:07.610
you won't let me

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:09.410
have this new shipment of goods.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.900
But I still have one request:

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.020
keep that shipment

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.400
and do not sell it to the Japanese.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.190
This mess was caused
by your sudden change of mind on switching

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.320
the payment currency to U.S. dollars.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:22.020
Commercial law

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.680
defines war as force majeure.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.780
It won't be considered a breach

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.170
of contract if I suspend payments.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.830
If you want the money
for the previous shipment,

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:29.930
you must promise me

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.290
not to sell this new shipment
to the Japanese.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.280
Fine, I won't do that, okay?

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.630
Can you guarantee I'll get paid?

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.390
Whether or not those U.S. dollar bills

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.120
are intact or retrievable,

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.300
as long as you keep the goods
from the Japanese,

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.200
I'll see to it that you get paid.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.890
When the bills are recovered, I'll pay up.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.290
If they're forever lost,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.930
I'll put all my assets for sale,

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.980
including my house and land,
or borrow from loan sharks

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.130
to make sure you receive
every penny you deserve.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:15.390
But if you sell the goods to the Japanese,

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.630
don't blame me for refusing to pay.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.000

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:41.690
I'm fine.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.330

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.390
Yes, I am fine.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:50.600
When

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.060
Quan brought those U.S. dollars back,

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.550
he told me that Huilong Bank
was bombed.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.640
I was frightened out of my wits.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.090
Yet you dashed into it
despite the explosion.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.950
Please don't do that again, okay?

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.890
What can be more important than your life?

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:06.700
Don't worry.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.060
Where's that box of U.S. dollars?

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.260
Father has it now.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:17.800
Wait.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.670
Father

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.630
heard some gossip about you.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:23.390
He's a bit upset.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:27.390
I get it.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:38.000
There are...

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:39.640
six.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:40.480
Right, six.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.090
Note it down.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:41.540
Okay.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.000
Renyu.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:46.780
Sir.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.920
Why are you home so late today?

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:50.850
There was a run on the bank
the entire day.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.040
People formed a line
that stretched over a kilometer.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.350
Due to lack of manpower,

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.810
I had to work till just now.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:57.550
Mr. Heng,

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.390
I can handle the rest myself.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.480
Go get some rest now.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.390
Okay, got it.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:02.670
I'll be going then.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:03.200
Okay.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.390
What are you doing?

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.540
The orphanage has taken in
many refugee children.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.260
The housemother
said they were out of food.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.520
I plan to send
what we have at home to them.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.460
But these...

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.260
can only last them for a few days.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.890
Renyu,

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.910
is there any money on you?

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:26.300
The bank has imposed withdrawal limits.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.150
Each person

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.610
can only withdraw 100 Hong Kong dollars.

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:31.520
I can't access my funds either.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.410
Use it sparingly.

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:35.090
Okay.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:49.200
Father,

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:50.700
I'm back.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.240
Father...

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.190
Kneel.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.260
Before our ancestors,

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:42.950
answer truthfully.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:44.930
Yes.

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:46.870
Throughout this day,

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.020
did you engage in dishonest conduct
in business?

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:50.980
No.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:52.190
Did you

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:53.540
break any promises?

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.130
No.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.950
In any other thing you did,
did you live up to

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.410
the teachings of our ancestors

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.000
and act with a clear conscience?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.460
I, He Xian, swear that I haven't done

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.000
anything deviated from my duty.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.930
My conscience remains clear.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:07.280
Nonsense!

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.930
How dare you lie before our ancestors!

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:11.390
I'll beat you to death, you dishonorable

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:12.740
disgrace to the family!

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.350
Father, Father!

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:21.910
Let go!

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.280
On... your knees.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:29.800
Kneel!

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:34.980
Tell me.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.110
What got into you and drove you

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:39.330
to scam your industry peers

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.300
for

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.370
filthy lucre?

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:43.890
I didn't.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.170
How dare you deny it.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.460
What you've done

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:51.710
has become the talk of the neighborhood.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.370
Now, outside,

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.460
everyone is pointing fingers
at the He family!

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.090
Are all these people

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.000
falsely accusing you?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:01.800
And...

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.650
What's in this box?

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.400
U.S. dollars I got exchanged

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:09.290
for a client.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:12.300
Client?

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:13.900
What client?

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.640
I promised him confidentiality,

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:20.010
so I can't tell.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:23.240
Not even to me?

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:25.890
No.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:31.890
You...

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:33.650
Go on.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.150
Father,

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.760
by exchanging currency
for a client this time,

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.090
I did cause losses to some industry peers.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:43.190
But it was purely coincidental.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:44.760
I had no prior knowledge

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.560
of Japan's attacks at Hong Kong.

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.800
Besides,

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.850
I can guarantee

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.370
this client is a legitimate businessman.

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:54.220
He had a valid reason
for this urgent exchange of currency.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.780
And this business deal of his

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.710
is related to national interests.

00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:59.390
Therefore, I had to

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.050
do my utmost to help him.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:05.350
Are you...

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.600
telling the truth?

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:09.460
I swear to you

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:10.560
and our ancestors

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.490
that every word I've spoken

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.630
is absolutely true.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:19.460
I'll believe you this time.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:21.650
Get up.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.100
But I have one more question.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.250
You got this box of U.S. dollars

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.430
exchanged for a client.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:39.280
It was so important an issue

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.780
that no mistake was allowed.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.720
You did the right thing

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.850
by risking your life to bring this box

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.260
out of flames.

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.980
But why did you rush

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.060
back into the fire again afterwards?

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.390
Did you care that much about

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.320
those measly possessions inside?

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:55.260
You're head of our family.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.310
If something had happened to you,

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.040
how would that leave Qiwen

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.100
and the children?

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.110
Father,

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.040
I know I made a very risky move.

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:11.390
But at that moment,

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:13.500
I had no choice
but to go back into the fire,

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.630
because this ledger must be preserved

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.480
under all circumstances.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.450
Huilong's record of deposit accounts?

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.500
[Deposit Accounts]

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.150
Yes.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:35.330
Huilong is a small bank.

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:37.480
Those who deposit money with us

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.010
are mostly ordinary people

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:40.240
of modest means.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.510
They entrust their hard-earned money

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:42.610
[Li Tianyou deposited 120 dollars]
[Zhao Xuebao deposited 20 dollars]

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:43.650
to Huilong for my management

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:44.950
and interest earnings,

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:46.370
which shows complete trust

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:47.450
in me and Huilong.

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:49.470
Now, with Hong Kong in crisis,

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.460
everyone lives in uncertainty.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.300
These deposits

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.760
could be life-saving money
for many of them.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.400
I must ensure
they don't lose all their assets.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:07.300
Xian,

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.300
you made

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.450
the right choice.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.960
What do you plan to do next?

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:21.690
I will, of course,

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.000
raise funds

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.660
and prepare cash for deposit withdrawals.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:26.800
But now,

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.700
all the cash in Huilong has been burned.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.390
All trading has been suspended
on both the stock exchange

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.190
and the currency exchange due to war.

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:34.870
I can't cash the investments
made for the clients.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:36.700
As for the money
we lent to our industry peers,

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.430
I failed to get even a penny back

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:39.980
after a whole day of trying.

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:44.190
Tell me.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.310
How much money do you need now?

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.200
I did some rough calculations.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.200
If I sell the house

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.580
and put together all I can offer,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.400
only 40% of the deposits can be paid out.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.630
That's far from enough.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.430
I'd hate to let the depositors
suffer losses.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.110
So,

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.130
I'll raise as many funds

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:11.060
as possible to pay out
the deposits proportionally.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.460
All I ask for

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.320
is a clear conscience.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.260
I understand.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.500
You may leave now.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.390
Qiwen,

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:45.030
I want a word with you.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.330
No need.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.860
I heard what you and Father said.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:53.060
Just do

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.060
whatever you set your mind to.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.280
No need to ask me at all.

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:00.720
I'm sorry.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:02.720
From now on,

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.320
I'm afraid you'll be put through

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:06.630
some lean days with me.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:08.790
What kind of talk is that?

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.850
We're husband and wife.

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:14.810
Of course we'll weather through
all difficulties together.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.260
Don't worry.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.260
I'm here to take care of the family,

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:19.790
alright?

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.530
We'll get through this.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:36.830
Father.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:38.690
Father.

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:46.300
Here is

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.800
everything I own.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:50.680

See if they're enough.

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:54.890
You worked your entire life for these.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:56.550
You need them for your old age.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:57.970
I can't take these.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.490
The He family's reputation

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.000
matters more than me, an old man.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.890
Xian,

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:07.560
sit down.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.720
Father, let me do it.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:37.990
It's fine to lose the business

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.960
and close the money changer.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.850
But we must keep...

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.590
a clear conscience.

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:49.190
I'm already

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.760
a man with one foot in the grave.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.540
What's the use of keeping all this money?

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.460
It will eventually go to my descendants.

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:04.070
As long as they learn to be honest people

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:06.720
of integrity,

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.720
what does it matter

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.110
if they have money or not?

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:16.500
Spending all this
on maintaining a clear conscience

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:19.180
is more worthwhile than on anything else.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:23.700
Father.

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:30.410
Mr. Lyu,

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:32.930
why do you only pay out 20% of my deposit?

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:34.860
Why can't I withdraw more than 15%?

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.800
Yeah!

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:38.650
Mr. Lyu,

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:43.890
Mr. Lyu!

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.370
-This won't do!
-Give us our money back!

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:48.470

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:49.410

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.159
Mr. He,

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:28.239
can we really make withdrawals
from Huilong?

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.310
Yes, you can.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.429
What's the percentage?

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.540

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:37.139
Yes, I do.

yet they still honor
all withdrawal requests.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:39.850

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.140
It is true.

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.830
There should be a little bit left.

Okay.

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.000
Isn't there only one choice?

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.850
Just listen.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.300
The sound of artillery
is coming from the Island non-stop.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.770
I think the British

Once travel between Hong Kong

and Macau resumes as the fire ceases,

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.890
we should set off for Macau.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.730
Well,

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.410
we'll see about that.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:57.350
Fine.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.180
Mull it over then.

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.890

five...

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:15.060
Five big apples.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:16.890
Why five?

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:19.350
Because Grandpa, Dad,

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:20.100
Mom,

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:23.910
you, and I should each have one apple.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:24.960
That's right.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.450
But

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:29.910
the apples in this drawing can't be eaten.

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.250
Let me ask you.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:33.310
Why do we eat apples on Christmas Eve?

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:35.310
That's the way

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:37.340
we pray for safety.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.290
Then listen.

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:40.680
As long as these are apples,

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.290
be they in a painting

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:44.310
or actually edible,

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:46.250
they'll make our wish
for safety come true.

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.710
Really?

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:49.540
Is it sweet?

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:50.730
Yes.

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:18.730
What's wrong?

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:20.890
Is something bothering you?

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.950
Are there depositors
who haven't made withdrawals?

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.680
All the depositors

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:32.740
have received their money,

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:34.980
except our biggest client,

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:36.670
who deposited a large sum

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.000
and requested anonymity.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:41.830
Since that was a special case,

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:43.890
I made a note about him on the last page

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.660
for differentiation
from the other depositors.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.460
Though the last page was burned,

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.750
I vividly remember his face and the amount

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:53.930
of his deposit.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.370
How much?

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:58.830
A bit

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:00.910
more than 30,000.

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:07.250
That is to say,

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.810
if this client withdraws his deposit,

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:12.330
we'll be left penniless.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:16.580
It's been over 10 days.

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.680
I don't know why he hasn't

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:19.520
shown up yet.

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:21.390
I also have no idea

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.810
whether he'll come
to get this money or not.

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:24.710
But Huilong

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:26.860
won't stop providing

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:29.580
withdrawal service until tomorrow.

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:57.660
Merry Christmas Eve.

00:41:58.330 --> 00:41:59.160
Merry Christmas Eve,

00:41:59.160 --> 00:41:59.850
Renyu.

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:03.230
Freshly baked apple pie.

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:03.950
Eat up.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:06.440
This is for you.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:09.090
Grabbing with your hands again?

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.210
This reminds me of the past.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.640
When you were only 7 years old,

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:30.720
you devoured a large apple pie

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.700
all at once.

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:34.480
The priest and the housemother
were shocked.

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.890
I was starving.

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:37.230
I hadn't eaten all day.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.740
On every Christmas Eve

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.390
after that day, the housemother

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:42.680
would make an apple pie
specifically for you,

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.010
regardless of what was served for dinner.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.730
Then we grew up and left the orphanage.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:51.040
You became the one
making me an apple pie every year.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.880
On each and every future Christmas Eve,

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.710
I will always

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.770
make you an apple pie right on time.
