00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.699
About tonight,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.140
thank you, Sir Yang.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.140
Young Madam,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.339
I'm lacking in ability.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.620
I failed to rescue the young master,
but I will do my utmost to keep him alive.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.860
Everything depends on you, Sir Yang.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.980
Yet, there is one more thing

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.820
that troubles me greatly.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.220
While in the prison,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.259
I heard them
mention Prince Duan several times.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.339
Why was that?

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.100
There must be a reason behind it.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.340
Sir Yang,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.940
for the sake of the Xiao family,
could you tell me a little?

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.680
Years ago, Prince Duan returned
to the capital under a secret decree,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.760
but was mistaken for a criminal
by Luo Yu, the gate officer,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.180
and was beaten deliberately.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.579
The heir, Qi Sheng,
collided with Luo Yu during the chaos

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.979
and almost lost his life.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.540
Fortunately, Eldest Young Master
and Sixth Young Master saved him.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.499
Later, when Luo Yu saw his plot fail,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.179
he kowtowed more than a hundred times,
and knelt for three whole days,

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.000
only then did he
earn the heir's forgiveness.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.980
It is likely that he still
holds a grudge to this day.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.819
Then, regarding the Xiao family today,

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.740
could it also be related to Prince Duan?

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.580
I do not know.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.419
However, there has long been a rumor

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.060
that the Xiao family
assisted Prince Duan's return back then.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.219
Later, during the struggle for
the throne against the Crown Prince,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.780
Prince Duan failed to claim succession.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.100
When the new emperor
ascended the throne,

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.060
the Prince Duan Manor
shut its doors to guests,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.379
avoiding court affairs

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.460
entirely.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.140
Thank you, Sir Yang.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.140
The Xiao family also thanks you.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.820
The life of Sixth Young Master

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.059
will be entrusted to you.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.620
Young Madam, no need to be so polite.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.979
I heard that on your wedding day

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.540
you suddenly fell gravely ill.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.300
The marriage was not completed.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.300
When the young general returns,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.740
he will surely marry you properly.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.380
Young Madam,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.540
take this lantern.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.540
You will not fear the dark road ahead.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.260
Thank you, Sir.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.940
Can Yan still hold on?

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.700
Young Master Xie

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.740
is not in serious danger.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.339
I heard that Young Master Xie

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.340
is close with Heir Qi Sheng.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.340
I wish to ask the Heir for help.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.780
How may I request an audience with him?

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.020
Do you think we
have not thought of seeking the Heir?

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.859
Yet now, every official in court

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.980
avoids the Xiao family like a plague.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.779
The Heir fears
bringing trouble upon himself.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.739
I understand,

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.540
but I still wish to try.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.620
Perhaps another way exists.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.260
I know what I did in the past

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.660
is hard for the Xiao family to forgive.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.100
Grand Madam, please

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.820
allow me to try once more.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.260
Although you have not married
into the Xiao family yet,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.580
in spirit, you are most like one of us.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.620
This is the Xiao family heirloom.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.499
Take it with you,

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.420
the Heir will grant you an audience.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.620
Mother,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.539
something this precious,

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.420
how could you entrust it to an outsider?

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.340
I know you resent her.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.540
Yet if she dared risk her life

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.100
to enter the Imperial Prison
and see Yan,

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.900
she is someone worth trusting.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.020
Risk her life for what?

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.140
From the moment she walked in,

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.579
I smelled blood on her.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.980
How do you get hurt so badly?

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.980
I am fine.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.539
Right now, the most important thing

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.140
is to rescue Young Master Xie.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.579
Mother,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.539
are we really letting her
go seek the Heir like this?

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.620
What if she...

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.620
There is no what if.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.659
A desperate gamble

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.660
may be safer.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Do you think

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.860
without a private seal,

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.099
without treasonous documents,

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.579
the charges against the Xiao family

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.220
could not be forged?

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.499
The one who truly
wants the Xiao family destroyed

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.539
is the hidden mastermind
within the court.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.220
Yuan is not wrong.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.059
Only by pulling the Heir into this chaos

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.100
will they hesitate to strike further.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.580
Only then do we have a chance
to survive this calamity.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.380
I only hope

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.420
Heaven grants
the Xiao family a little mercy.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.659
- The kitchen is calling you.
- I will go.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.540
Fine.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.580
Young Master, please have some tea.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:59.820
Slowly.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.020
Try this as well.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.740
Thank you.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.620
Is this better?

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.860
Allow me.

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:19.557
(Heir of Prince Duan, Qi Sheng)

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.500
(So it really is him.)

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.260
(It seems I guessed right.)

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.720
(In my previous life,
the man who rebelled with Xie Yunyan)

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.600
(was none other than Qi Sheng,
the Heir of Prince Duan.)

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.980
(Then he must not be one
to submit to others.)

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.419
(He must harbor resentment
toward the current court.)

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.860
(He may be
the Xiao family's only chance.)

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.819
You, a young woman,

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.340
coming to me disguised as a man,

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.060
what is it you intend?

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.500
Your Highness, please stop.
I am Xiao Yunxi's wife, Su Jinyuan.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.580
Your Highness.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.420
So it is you.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.100
Did you not flee from your marriage?

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.659
What is this? Now that trouble
has come to the Xiao Manor,

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.020
you claim to be his wife again.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.180
What exactly is your purpose?

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.540
I heard that in your youth,

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.460
you were close
with my husband's sixth brother.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.340
Now he is imprisoned
under false charges.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.740
The Xiao family
stands accused of treason.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.619
I beg Your Highness

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:10.940
to lend us your aid.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.540
Treason is a grave crime.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.300
It has enraged His Majesty.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.380
If the Prince Duan Manor intervenes now,

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.540
would that not invite disaster
upon itself?

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.100
It seems I have misjudged Your Highness.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.500
I thought you were a hero of the age.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.459
Yet it turns out you are

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.180
no different from the common and timid.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.379
And I thought
you were no ordinary woman.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.380
You only know
how to provoke people, do you not?

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.779
Of course not.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.619
I came here

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.540
to offer Prince Duan a way to survive.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.980
Would you like to hear it?

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.100
Me, the Prince Duan Manor,

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.620
would never need you to save our lives.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.460
Your Highness cannot believe

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.099
that this turbulent situation

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.859
targets only the Xiao family.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.739
As for the true reason
behind their downfall,

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.540
surely Your Highness
has already guessed.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.899
Once they destroy the Xiao family,

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.540
who do you think will be next?

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.459
Back then,
during the struggle for the throne,

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.700
the Xiao family was regarded
as Prince Duan's faction.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.939
And now,

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.779
His Majesty has only recently
ascended the throne.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.700
There are already those who cannot wait

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.820
to direct suspicion toward Prince Duan.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.379
Yet they fear
the Xiao family's military power

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.379
which restrains the Emperor's hand.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.379
Therefore, they must
first destroy the Xiao family

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.260
before accusing Prince Duan of treason.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.700
What judgment do you think
His Majesty will give then?

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.619
How dare you presume the Emperor's will?

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.380
What exactly are you plotting?

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.260
It is the Xiao family His Majesty fears,

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.100
not the Prince Duan Manor.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.539
Your father, Prince Duan,

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.300
can only remain
uninvolved due to his status.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.699
But if Your Highness

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.900
also ignore the Xiao family's fall,

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.620
then ruin will reach Prince Duan Manor

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.220
soon enough.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.340
Only if both our families share fate,

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.259
may there be a path to survival.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.740
How do you know
such confidential matters?

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.420
I am here

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.460
on behalf of the Xiao family

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.020
to express our sincerity to Prince Duan.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.620
If we can survive this calamity,

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.539
the Xiao family

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.620
will never betray him.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.500
But if the Xiao family is abandoned,

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.220
Your Highness will also have no way out.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.900
Very well.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.419
I will investigate the Xiao case.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.780
I will also stir public opinion
through the Imperial Academy.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.939
Then I will lead a petition

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.300
in court to clear their name.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.300
However, whether it succeeds

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.260
depends on your fortune and timing.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.340
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.459
(Zichen Gate)

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.460
(The land weeps blood,
sun and moon grow dim.)

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.699
(Xiao Manor)
(Grand General Xiao Manor,)

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.460
(three generations guarded the borders,
nine great wars secured the realm.)

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.659
(Yet traitors slandered them
within the court,)

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.699
(accusing them of treason
and collusion with the enemy,)

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.260
(a crime conjured from nothing.)

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.980
(Thus loyal souls
were to be erased from history.)

00:12:50.212 --> 00:12:51.132
Grandmother.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.420
Yuan.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.340
Early this morning,

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.459
the Imperial Academy students

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.040
presented this proclamation
at the palace gates.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.020
Every word sharp and piercing,
each sentence a blade.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.419
Truly the Heir's writing.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.700
Prince Duan Manor
is not to be underestimated.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.400
To calm public outrage,

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.080
His Majesty has ordered
a full investigation into the Xiao case.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.200
He decrees the release of Sixth Young Master,
and lifts the seal on Xiao Manor.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.100
We shall await
the General's return to the capital.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.099
Yuan.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:16.700
Go,

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.340
bring Yan home.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.860
Grandmother.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.180
Mother.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.420
I, Yan, am unfilial,

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.380
I have made you worry.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.060
Rise quickly.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:40.939
Yan,

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.300
for the sake of the Xiao family,

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.540
you have suffered greatly.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.739
If you had not
endured torture in prison,

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.340
standing firm against wicked men,

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.460
the Xiao family
may have already been destroyed.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.640
The Xiao family's kindness
to me is as great as a mountain.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.480
What I suffered
is nothing in comparison.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.739
Yes.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.379
My mother often tells me

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.859
that Jinyuan has suffered

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.900
a lot for us.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.539
Mother said she fought so desperately
only because she was determined

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.460
to bring Sixth Brother back safely.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.459
As long as the two of you are here,

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.219
our Xiao family

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.220
will surely remain safe and well.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.420
Then let us all thank Jinyuan together.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.900
Do you agree, Yunxuan?

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.059
Jinyuan,

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.779
in the future, I will be like you,

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.379
and protect our family too.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.139
But Jinyuan,

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.020
you must take good care of yourself.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.340
Mother said your health
has never been well.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.099
On the wedding day, you fell ill,

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.420
so the marriage could not be completed.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.300
Jinyuan.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.579
These days

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.340
you have indeed suffered much.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.140
Come, let us offer incense
to our ancestors.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.659
We shall thank them for watching over

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.380
and protecting the Xiao family.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.059
(Ever Lasting in History)

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.220
Ancestors of the Xiao family,

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.300
I, the unworthy granddaughter-in-law,

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.820
Su Jinyuan,

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.180
ask forgiveness from the Xiao family.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.660
From this day forward,
we share the same boat in wind and rain.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.300
