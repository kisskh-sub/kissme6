Li Wu.

Let's start tidying up.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.190
Sister, sit for a moment.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.180
I'll finish tidying soon.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.840
Your younger brother
is so self-sufficient.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.030
How did you teach him?

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.010
I didn't teach him.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.310
At home,

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.530
he always tidies up by himself.

00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:28.970
No need to supervise
his studies much.

00:03:28.977 --> 00:03:29.690
He's very sensible.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.130
This young man is really great.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.750
Where's Cheng Rui?

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.360
Didn't you say

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.777
he's in the same room as you?

Senior students from our faculty
also recommended this place.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.533

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:30.780

Why are you still so busy

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.711
during the New Year holiday?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.680
The school has a new project.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.020
The teacher took me along.

00:07:13.488 --> 00:07:14.530
What about Cheng Rui?

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.870
I messaged him on WeChat.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.800
He said his gift was already
given to you in advance.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.970
So he won't celebrate with us.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.900
He went to Yan City for New Year's.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.260
What's he going to do there?

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.700
Internship?

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.580
Sort of.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.370
And you?

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.610
Any extracurricular activities?

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.100
I...

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.160
I signed up

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.850
for a bridge club.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.220
Bridge club?

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.720
With your mental age,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.680
it wouldn't make sense

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.711
if you're under forty.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:49.370
No.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.000
Face looks twenty,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.850
and heart is forty.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.120
Isn't that perfect?

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.070
Balances it out.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.340
Equals thirty.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:58.100
Alright.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.100
Then I wish you

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.780
a Happy 30th birthday.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.460
Thank you.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.630
Set up a memorial installation

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.000
to enhance visual interaction,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.100
and self-exploration.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.000
Our biggest idea this time

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.010
is actually to use acrylic material,

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.360
to make

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.720
a huge contact lens art installation.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.600
And we also set up
an interactive experience area,

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.977
using virtual reality technology...

00:08:49.755 --> 00:08:50.650
Take a seat first.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:57.750
I think this idea

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.730
is pretty good.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.340
But it might be hard to implement.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:03.770
Ted, it's like this.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.010
We did research,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.200
collected data,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.150
and fully analyzed

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:07.910
user profiles.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:08.840
And in fact,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.870
our target audience

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.790
is even more

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:11.510
into this kind

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.000
of exhibition than we expected.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.610
I know.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.320
I said it.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.490
Your creativity is great.

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:17.010
But no matter how good the idea,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.850
the client has to pay for it.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:20.730
Yes, but...

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:21.970
Alright, Ted.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.080
Let's think again

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.870
if there's a more practical approach

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.060
or a better idea.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.010
Okay.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:29.730
That's it for today.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.770
Thanks, everyone.

00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:32.200
Meeting adjourned.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:40.730
Alright.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:41.790
Don't all of you

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.820
make this face.

00:09:42.866 --> 00:09:45.266
It's not like your proposals
haven't been rejected before.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.730
Alright.

00:09:48.911 --> 00:09:49.630
Let's eat first.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.340
Relax a bit.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.200
There will definitely
be an optimal solution.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.130
Rejected every day.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.940
Why are you back?

00:10:05.022 --> 00:10:07.080
Tomorrow, I have a part-time job
at the milk tea shop.

00:10:07.088 --> 00:10:08.644
It's more convenient to go from home.

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:09.840
How long are you planning

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.100
to keep this part-time job?

00:10:11.288 --> 00:10:12.650
Going back and forth constantly,

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.370
can you manage schoolwork?

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.770
It's going quite well here.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.960
And I can keep up

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.955
with school courses.

00:10:23.266 --> 00:10:25.630
It's just that the school is far
from the milk tea shop.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.750
So, if I do part-time work
in the future,

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.010
I'll probably stay at home.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.630
Alright.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.266
As long as it doesn't affect studies.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.180
I'll take out the trash.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.180
Okay.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.610
Sister.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.770
Thank you.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.060

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.820
Come on.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.100
A little closer.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.010
Li Wu.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.820
Has anyone ever told you

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.250
that your eyes are beautiful?

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.890
Don't move.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:56.730
Got it.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:57.870
You really are

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:58.770
my muse of inspiration.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.580
You really helped a lot.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.940
(I have an idea.)

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.200
(One hour later,)

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.000
(I'll send the copy to the group.
Take a look.)

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.490
(Close your mouth.)

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.890
(Cover your ears.)

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.820
(Emotions will still show
through your eyes.)

00:13:37.688 --> 00:13:39.650
(Lu Tong: This is not bad.
I have a visual.)

00:13:39.688 --> 00:13:41.120
(Li Fei: Replace emotion with love.)

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:41.650
(How is it?)

00:13:41.866 --> 00:13:43.010
(It feels more tangible.)

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:22.890
Sister.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:24.490
Sister.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.440
Alright.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.777
You're getting more skilled now.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.200
Thank you.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.711
I'll go park in the basement.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.244
Do you want to have lunch together?

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.480
I have a video meeting at noon.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.370
Probably won't make it.

00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:46.100
You eat first, don't wait for me.

00:14:47.088 --> 00:14:48.550
When you drive into the basement,

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.700
the entrance is a bit narrow.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:50.610
Drive slowly.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:51.890
Okay.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.130
I'm leaving.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.870
Li Wu, close the window.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.300
The dust outside is blowing in.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:42.340
Oh my.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.540
(Cen Jin)

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.020
I...

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.890
Came out to say.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:51.180
(Cen Jin)

00:18:04.066 --> 00:18:05.600
What are you doing with my photo?

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:10.500
Speak.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.690
Sister.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.980
I like you.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.111
I've liked you for a long time.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.890
No.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.060
(Cen Jin)

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.030
Why not?

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:37.300
Because you can't like me.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.820
Why can't I like you?

00:18:42.577 --> 00:18:44.210
Do you even know what liking someone is?

00:18:45.266 --> 00:18:47.100
Li Wu, you've never been
in a relationship.

00:18:47.244 --> 00:18:49.680
You can't tell the difference
between liking and gratitude.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.555
There're two completely
different feelings.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.450
Right now you're

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.640
acting on impulse.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.500
A sudden urge.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:58.260
Let me make it clearer.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:59.720
You and I

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.780
are sister and brother.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:01.960
We're family,

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.060
not a romantic relationship.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.880
You need to sort out your feelings.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.890
Don't mix them up.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.850
I'm already twenty-one.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.880
I'm an adult.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.650
I know exactly what liking means.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.580
Twenty-one doesn't count as an adult.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.070
I'm teaching you.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.210
I don't need it.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:26.540
Fine.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.300
Then I won't accept it, okay?

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.370
What if I don't accept you?

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.340
Then I'll always like you.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.930
I'll only like you in this lifetime.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.750
I won't marry.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:38.930
I won't find a girlfriend.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.450
But I will definitely not bother you.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.200
Ten years later,

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.533
you won't be saying this anymore.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:47.650
How do you know I won't?

00:19:47.755 --> 00:19:49.777
Because I'm almost
ten years older than you.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.480
I know time

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.690
changes a person.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.160
When you reach my age

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.100
and look back,

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.820
you'll realize these words

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.510
are just venting emotions,

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:00.510
showing your immaturity

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.450
and nothing else.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.680
You're not me.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.980
Why do you get to decide?

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.555
I'm not trying to decide for anyone.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.830
But I won't give you
any answer you want.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.610
I'm not asking you
to give me an answer now.

00:20:11.266 --> 00:20:12.600
I just want to tell you

00:20:12.644 --> 00:20:13.650
that I like you.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.780
This is something in my heart.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:18.750
Whether now

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:19.510
or ten years later,

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.450
it's the same.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.410
How old will I be ten years later?

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.640
Do you think I'll always be thirty?

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.850
I'll grow up too.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.160
I'll work hard to get stronger.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.200
I will become someone you can rely on.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.340
I'll study hard.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.440
I'll find a...

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.610
But I can't wait.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.880
If you really

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.130
like me the way you say,

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.210
how could you let me wait for you?

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:45.410
Li Wu.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.820
I picked you up from Yunfeng,

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.690
and brought you back to study,

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:52.850
because I want to help you,

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.020
but more, I want to help myself.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.210
That period was very hard for me.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:20:59.980
Your arrival

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.980
distracted me perfectly,

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.060
and became my spiritual support.

00:21:04.533 --> 00:21:05.440
Helped me get through

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.690
that difficult time.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.400
So you don't have

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.260
to be too touched.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.200
This is also a step-by-step process

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.340
that led to today's result.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.820
I believe over the past year,

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.410
I've been very measured with you.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.160
If any of my actions

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.060
misled you,

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.450
I'm sorry.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:30.400
So now you're

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.088
trying to distance yourself from me...

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.410
Just because I said I like you?

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.450
Young age.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.210
Ambitious.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.240
I came to find you to figure things out,

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.500
not to add trouble.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.960
Li Wu is young.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.780
It's normal to like someone.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.610
But that person can't be me.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.610
Why can't it be you?

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.550
You're outstanding,

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.580
beautiful, wealthy,

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.170
and willing to spend on him.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.060
If not you, who else would he like?

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.500
I like you too.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.640
You haven't said a serious word.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.100
He is still young.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.450
How old is he?

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:52.260
He's already twenty-one.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:53.790
Next year,

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.210
he'll reach the legal marriage age.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.170
Then just think that way.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.410
An adult man likes you.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:02.680
If you like him too,

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.740
then be with him.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.930
If not, just stay away.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:07.210
Why worry?

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.270
He's not another man.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.210
He is Li Wu.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.540
You're just overthinking.

00:23:13.622 --> 00:23:14.880
Of course, I care about him.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.740
He's my brother.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:19.850
Then you

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.170
think like that.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.650
Maybe it's hormones.

00:23:24.044 --> 00:23:25.030
In a couple of days,

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.020
he might meet

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.210
a pretty senior or cute junior
at school,

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.130
and change his mind.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:43.930
Really handsome.

00:23:45.044 --> 00:23:45.920
My aesthetics has

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.300
updated again.

00:23:48.222 --> 00:23:49.133
I heard he's already

00:23:49.155 --> 00:23:50.830
been working part-time
for over half a year.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.580
Why didn't I notice before?

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.240
I deserve to be single.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.300
We noticed too late.

00:23:56.511 --> 00:23:57.650
I want to see him in person.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.680
Right away.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.450
Immediately.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:01.830
Is he really this handsome?

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:02.720
Really handsome.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.580
Don't you think so?

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.450
Exactly my type.

00:24:07.111 --> 00:24:08.800
I just sent a message to the store owner

00:24:08.822 --> 00:24:09.820
via WeChat.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.820
Let's order some milk tea,

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.270
and have it delivered.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.260
Good idea.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.580
What are you laughing at?

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:20.300
Jin.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.640
The handsome new staff

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.850
at the Meete Store downstairs.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.210
How is he?

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.260
Handsome, right?

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.270
Is he really that handsome?

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.155
Are you guys serious?

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.210
Really handsome.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.580
You're exaggerating too much.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.410
We're ordering milk tea.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:43.540
What do you want, Jin?

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.510
I don't want any.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:46.300
On a diet.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.740
Then we'll order.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.888
What do you want to drink?

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.350
Enough.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.500
Stop talking about milk tea.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.060
Prepare it.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:57.540
In ten minutes,

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.955
a meeting in the conference room.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.930
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.340
He wouldn't deliver it
during the meeting, right?

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.060
It's fine.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:06.550
The revised plan...

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:07.240
Milk tea's here.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:07.830
Next time...

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:11.540
Just put it over there.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.890
He is kind of handsome.

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:24.650
Send it to me later.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.130
I really want his WeChat.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.210
This one.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:45.200
I'll ask him

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.160
for his contact info.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:46.890
I can't wait.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.130
Remember to push me.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.820
So handsome.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:50.640
Don't you think

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.466
he's no worse
than those advertising models?

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:53.790
I've met him.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.622
I don't even want to work
with you guys anymore.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.500
You're exaggerating too much.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.210
Everyone's been working hard lately.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.000
This time,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.410
the plan of our offline event

00:26:01.444 --> 00:26:03.400
for colored contact lenses
is basically finalized.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.170
Everyone, keep up the good work.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.170
Refine the execution details.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:08.830
This is our first

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.210
major offline event this year.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.130
We must look great on stage.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:13.790
Go team!

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:14.930
- Okay.
- Okay, go.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:17.830
Go, go!

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:18.500
Jin.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:19.410
Jin.

00:26:19.755 --> 00:26:20.680
The production company

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.680
sent over the newly made

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.480
promo video.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.160
They're asking us
to give feedback quickly.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.320
They have other work planned
for the next couple of days,

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.155
and they're worried
they won't have time for us.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:28.930
Got it.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.266
Let's review it together now.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.780
Everyone,

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.020
meeting in five minutes.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:35.410
Okay.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:37.830
What's happening?

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.820
- Why is the power out?
- No way, what's going on?

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.500
Still power outages these days?

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:42.610
Go ask.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:43.300
Okay.

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:45.590
The property said our floor

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:46.750
had a circuit problem.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.300
They're contacting an electrician.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:49.440
How long will it take?

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.110
Not sure.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.511
We'll know when someone arrives.

00:26:51.666 --> 00:26:52.580
Where's the boss?

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:54.370
Jin.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.830
Are we still

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:56.600
having the meeting?

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.780
Of course.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.500
Jin.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.650
Or, shall we hold it
at the milk tea shop downstairs?

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.930
And so,

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.160
under the combined efforts

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.240
of my uncle and me,

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.890
Wen's parents finally understood

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.300
and reconciled with Wen.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.340
They said

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.300
from now on, they will
respect her decision.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.610
Wen is usually quite stubborn,

00:27:19.644 --> 00:27:21.955
but she actually still
cares a lot about her parents.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.980
When her parents
appeared at Yanbei University,

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.370
her eyes were swollen from crying.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.780
That's pretty good.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.820
Are you even listening to me?

00:27:32.977 --> 00:27:34.790
I said Wen's eyes
were swollen from crying.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:35.933
What's good about that?

00:27:35.977 --> 00:27:37.022
I mean...

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.200
It's good that she reconciled
with her parents.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:39.980
Pretty good.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.060
That's all thanks to me.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.650
I've been the peacemaker
for over half a year.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:50.890
What's up with you today?

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.580
You seem distracted.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:57.980
Cen Jin is here.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.960
Sit over here.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.333
Let's push the tables together.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.690
Why are you just standing there?

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.260
Help take the order.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.650
The back hasn't been wiped yet.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:23.980
Zeng.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:25.100
Help take the order.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.880
Hello.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.266
What would you like to drink?

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:31.450
What do you want?

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:33.500
I'll have a Jasmine Milk Green Tea.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:34.850
Me too.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:39.410
When will this meeting be over?

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:47.400
I'll go.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.410
He's coming.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.370
I'll help you.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:59.450
Thanks.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:16.890
Handsome guy.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:20.450
Do you remember me?

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:23.850
Yes.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.130
Since you still remember me,

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:27.640
would you consider

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.820
giving me your WeChat?

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.160
Alright.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.100
Stop teasing him.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:33.610
Who's teasing him?

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.650
You're so handsome.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.110
Are you interested

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.240
in getting into modeling?

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.020
I can help.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.410
I can help too.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.020
Yuan Zhen.

00:29:43.066 --> 00:29:44.130
I'm not bad-looking either.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:45.370
Take me along too.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.610
Focus on finishing
your current work first.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.300
My WeChat.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.650
I...

00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.450
Why?

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.480
Afraid your crush will know

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.210
and be upset?

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:15.410
Then...

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.540
If you decide, you can come to me again.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.930
I'll go to the restroom.

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:26.920
He already has a crush.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.800
Pick someone else.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:30.980
So scary.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.930
Even Cen Jin won't say a word for you.

00:30:47.866 --> 00:30:49.044
(Come out for a sec.)

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:55.260
What's wrong?

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.580
Li Wu.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.340
Quit this job.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.820
Why?

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.200
Are you afraid I'll tell your colleagues

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.410
that the person I like is you?

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.690
Your school is more than
20 kilometers away.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:28.340
Do you still want to study?

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.450
Is this really what you should be doing?

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.580
This is ridiculous.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:33.110
I told you

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.100
I want to be independent.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:35.590
And I only

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:36.680
spend one day a week

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.310
working here.

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:38.030
I've never

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:39.300
delayed my studies.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.170
Now it's different.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.580
What's different?

00:31:53.288 --> 00:31:54.680
I'll transfer back the 100,000 yuan

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.540
to you now.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.590
Focus on being a student,

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.088
and do what you're supposed to do.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.580
You wanted to distance yourself from me.

00:32:02.711 --> 00:32:04.311
Then why are you still bothering me?

00:32:07.977 --> 00:32:10.022
Then don't keep hanging around
in front of me.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.410
Fine.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.030
Today, you messaged

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:24.850
and asked me to come,

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.130
so I came.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:29.610
Next time, it won't be so easy.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:40.610
Li Wu!

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:42.210
Slow down!

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:43.980
I'm almost out of breath!

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:47.580
Li Wu!

00:32:47.955 --> 00:32:49.350
What you're doing is dangerous!

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:50.260
Stop for now!

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.740
Li Wu!

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.500
Be careful!

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.690
Li Wu!

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.610
What's wrong?

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:30.930
You're

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.740
not crying, right?

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:36.580
What exactly happened?

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.540
I messed up.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.100
Messed up what?

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.450
I told her I like her.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.400
She didn't even give me

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.300
the right to like her.

00:34:04.066 --> 00:34:05.650
She doesn't want to see me anymore.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.860
Alright.

00:34:18.733 --> 00:34:20.100
If it really doesn't work,

00:34:21.288 --> 00:34:23.130
would you like someone else instead?

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:34.610
I won't say anymore.

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:54.230
This color scheme is a bit strange.

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:56.000
Too saturated.
It looks a bit uncomfortable

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:56.770
on screen.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.960
Okay.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.800
Adjust it again.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.150
Okay.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.190
Jin, the products for display downstairs
have arrived.

00:35:01.222 --> 00:35:02.200
You need to check them.

00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:03.390
Okay, I'll go take a look.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.580
Then keep an eye on it.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:06.500
Don't use the green version.

00:35:06.511 --> 00:35:08.760
Leave the empty spots
for the main color of this season.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.250
Alright.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:36.100
Li Wu.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.590
It's been many days.

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:40.290
Talk to me more.

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:42.230
Wen is in Yan City now.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:43.730
It's fine if she's slow to reply.

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:45.920
You're just sitting next to me,

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.600
but you don't talk to me much either.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.020
Chun Chang.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.290
Li Wu.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.130
You really don't care about your sister.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.380
What happened to her?

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.590
She fell down the stairs today.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:08.100
You didn't know at all?

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.210
Where is she now?

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.590
She's at home.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.555
I just picked her up from the hospital.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.540
What's wrong?

00:36:16.577 --> 00:36:17.800
Bring these things back for me.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.200
And ask the school for two days off.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.920
My sister is injured.
I need to check on her.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.670
If you need help,

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:22.610
call me.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:25.690
What are you doing?

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.380
I said don't tell him.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.580
I'm alone.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.190
I still have to go to the store later.

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:32.170
My mom is coming too.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.880
You won't let me

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.000
tell your parents...

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:36.860
What should I do?

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:38.690
Leave you here alone?

00:36:39.577 --> 00:36:40.550
Besides, I'm not good

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:41.690
at taking care of people.

00:36:41.933 --> 00:36:43.511
What if your old injury isn't healed

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:44.800
and I cause you other problems?

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.330
What to do?

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:47.540
I can hire a caregiver.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:48.900
Hire a caregiver?

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:50.860
Doesn't that take time?

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.460
If you're unlucky

00:36:53.666 --> 00:36:55.000
and find someone who abuses you,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:55.770
what then?

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.190
Li Wu

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:00.280
is strong, healthy, and handsome.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.540
He truly cares about you.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.460
He's the best choice right now.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.540
Our relationship has ended up like this.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.380
How can I ask him to take care of me?

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.170
He really doesn't mind at all.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:11.670
Just now, on the phone,

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.977
he was already on his way back
before it was even finished.

00:37:16.755 --> 00:37:18.060
You're really something.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.810
I know I am.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.330
I warn you, treat me well.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.630
Before he comes,

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.488
I'm the only one
who can take care of you.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.250
Want some water?

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:29.690
I'm hungry. I want to eat.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.020
Alright, my young lady.

00:37:59.955 --> 00:38:01.420
Why are you standing there?

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:03.580
Li Wu is here.

00:38:05.488 --> 00:38:06.920
Tell him to go back to school.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.650
I want to sleep.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.500
Does it hurt?

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.860
Minor injury.

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:26.730
It doesn't hurt.

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:32.580
Jin.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.670
I have things at the store.
I'll go first.

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:35.580
I'll come tomorrow.

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:37.610
Li Wu, take care of your sister.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.420
Okay.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.330
(You just leave me here alone?)

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.920
(What's inconvenient)

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.222
(about your own younger brother?)

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:50.130
(Don't worry.)

00:39:50.133 --> 00:39:51.320
(I'll come back after I'm done.)

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.711
(I'll leave it to your brother
to take care of you for a while.)

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:19.480
You ran over...

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.380
What about school?

00:40:21.222 --> 00:40:23.177
Cheng Rui already asked
for leave for me.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.460
Is it serious?

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.330
Just a bone fracture.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.100
I will be fine in a few weeks.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:39.330
This leg of mine

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:40.770
is fine now.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.770
Don't move around.

00:40:45.466 --> 00:40:46.980
If it shifts again, it'll be trouble.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.130
What are you doing?

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.980
Raise the leg a bit.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.980
It helps blood circulation,

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.420
and can prevent swelling.

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.290
How do you know so much?

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.900
I took care of my grandfather

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.940
for many years,

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.460
so I have more experience.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.810
Especially

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:21.960
for cases like this,

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.170
where they can't walk.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.060
I'm not paralyzed.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.540
I know.

00:41:40.422 --> 00:41:42.380
Are you going to stand by my bed
all the time?

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:50.210
Do you want some water?

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.860
No.

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:56.330
Then,

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.770
is there anything you want to eat?

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:04.580
I just ate.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.380
Alright then...

00:42:14.155 --> 00:42:15.690
Just rest more.
