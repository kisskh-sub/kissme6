(Zichen Gate)

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.100
Su Jinyuan.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.900
It was you who brought shame
upon the Xiao family.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.339
And now you dare ask me for justice.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.100
Should I call you shameless,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.580
or simply reckless?

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.940
Your Majesty, please discern the truth.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.539
I, Su Jinyuan,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.380
can endure such slander myself,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.860
but the Xiao family cannot.

00:01:50.312 --> 00:01:52.872
The sons of the Xiao clan
died on the battlefield,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.710
leaving behind widows and orphans.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.579
Yet now,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.020
they are left
to be bullied and humiliated.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.660
So you mean

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.460
I have neglected and dishonored
those who earned merit?

00:02:09.887 --> 00:02:11.424
I have come today,

00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:13.225
only to ask for a clear decree.

00:02:13.262 --> 00:02:15.342
Let those who insult
the Xiao family know

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.620
that even without sons serving at court,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.845
the Xiao clan is still
under Imperial protection.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.140
Why should I grant you favor

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.860
and make an exception
for the Xiao family?

00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:44.735
The Xiao clan served loyally
for generations.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.136
What I ask today

00:02:46.137 --> 00:02:48.217
is merely a place to stand.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.259
Your Majesty's legacy
will last for ages.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.300
Though our contribution is small,

00:02:52.612 --> 00:02:54.172
it is better than none.

00:02:57.787 --> 00:03:01.307
Bold words for a woman
who fears no death.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.780
If I refuse you today,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.780
others may call me cold and unfeeling.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.860
Very well.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.060
Then I shall decree this.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.179
Your name shall be cleared.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.460
Xie Yunyan will be granted
an official post.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.780
Are you satisfied?

00:03:41.312 --> 00:03:43.819
Thanks Your Majesty
for this great grace.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.180
Long live the Emperor.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.060
This is enough?

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.579
Will you return tomorrow

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.380
with another request,

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.350
beating the grievance drum again?

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.624
I know I have offended the throne,

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:05.905
a grave sin indeed.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.750
I accept Your Majesty's punishment.

00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:14.245
At least you know your place.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.374
Go to the palace gate,

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:19.055
and receive the court caning yourself.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.430
You are awake.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.060
Where is she?

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.460
Go meet her at the palace gate.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.300
She struck the grievance drum,

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.340
and pled for justice
for the Xiao family.

the price she paid is worth it.

00:06:09.462 --> 00:06:10.782
I said before,

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.539
I will win it myself.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.259
Let go.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.779
If you rush into the palace now,

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.780
her suffering will be in vain.

Are you not afraid

that punishment might kill her?

Young Lady Su did all this for you.

I did not mean it that way.

sounds a bit strange.

That somehow sounds

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.340
even stranger.

Alright, Physician Xi,

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.540
stop teasing him.

Young Lady Su, your Sixth Brother

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.660
is rather amusing.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.379
Such honest foolishness is rare.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.099
Yet he treats you sincerely and loyally.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.099
Physician Xi,

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.620
you seem unusually attentive
to my Sixth Brother.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.219
Young Lady Su, could it be

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.220
that you are jealous?

00:10:27.362 --> 00:10:29.402
What nonsense are you saying again?

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.161
I just thought,

00:10:31.162 --> 00:10:33.082
Physician Xi is also a woman.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.259
If you like my Sixth Brother,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.980
it is possible.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.340
So you already knew I was a girl.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.300
Enough of that.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.780
Only you treat your Sixth Brother
like a treasure.

00:10:50.512 --> 00:10:51.986
But I

00:10:51.987 --> 00:10:52.824
prefer instead

00:10:52.825 --> 00:10:55.065
soft and sweet young ladies.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.260
How about this?

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.260
Shall I call you
Little Yuan from now on?

00:11:00.575 --> 00:11:02.415
Then I will call you Ning.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.460

We were wrong, please spare us.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.779
Young Master.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.979
By law,

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.700
malicious slander against others

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.460

Thank you Captain for showing mercy.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:53.100
I will discipline
my household well from now on.

00:12:08.787 --> 00:12:11.107
What you endured today

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.940
is nothing compared to hers.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.460
If not for the law restraining me,

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.060
I would have you
suffer the same pain she bore.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:22.699
Yu.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.860
Su Xinyue.

00:12:24.527 --> 00:12:25.686
You two spread false rumors

00:12:25.687 --> 00:12:27.847
against Su Jinyuan,
First Young Madam of the Xiao family.

00:12:27.862 --> 00:12:30.862
His Majesty
has granted her name justice.

00:12:31.512 --> 00:12:33.712
If anyone slanders her again
in the future,

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:35.687
they shall share the same punishment.

00:12:43.275 --> 00:12:44.675
Go back inside.

00:12:44.775 --> 00:12:46.295
Haven't you
embarrassed yourselves enough?

00:12:51.612 --> 00:12:52.732
Su Jinyuan,

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.580
you humiliated me today.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.995
One day, I will return it double.

00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:02.420
(Half a month later)

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.340
I heard you took over
the garrison for only three days,

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.645
yet you won more hearts
than Luo Yu did in three years.

00:13:10.162 --> 00:13:12.482
With fire burning this high,

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.739
you'd best beware

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.180
of scorching your own family's shrine.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.979
If I do not gain
the soldiers' trust quickly,

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.540
how can I uncover
the truth of the Xiao case?

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.540
The blood of 30,000 soldiers at Linchuan

00:13:27.087 --> 00:13:29.847
will have to be paid for
by someone on their knees.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:35.980
Xie,

00:13:36.212 --> 00:13:37.849
why not act the carefree wastrel?

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.419
Let them think you
no longer pursue the matter.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.860
Perhaps clues

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.507
will surface on their own.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.379
Your tactic of retreating
to advance is quite elegant.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.619
But teaching Yan

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.660
to feign weakness just to strike later

00:13:51.512 --> 00:13:53.632
may be harder for him
than fighting on the field.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.420
Young Lady Su is brave and clever.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.100
Sharp-minded and witty.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.780
My manor happens
to lack someone to prepare ink for me.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.740
If Young Lady Su

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.700
is willing to come
to Prince Duan's Manor,

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.380
your presence would make it
all the more pleasant.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.760
Mind your words, Your Lordship.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.420
The affairs of the Xiao household
need no concern from Your Lordship.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.020
(Qi Sheng hides his intentions well.)

00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:33.397
(If I could form an alliance with him,)

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.620
(Xiao Manor)

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.100
(could rise again.)

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.631
If Your Lordship
truly lacks someone to grind ink, then I...

00:14:40.632 --> 00:14:41.859
However humble our roof may be,

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.300
it still has room for you.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.660
Xie,

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.899
You sulk just like

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.700
Wangcai guarding his bowl back home.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.219
You pining over someone like this looks

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.660
just like a piglet fighting
for scraps in my backyard.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.100
I take my leave.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.820
Su Jinyuan.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.540
Interesting.
