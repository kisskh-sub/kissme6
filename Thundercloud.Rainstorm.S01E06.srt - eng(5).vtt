00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.440
Everyone.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.070
Mr. Seo is very satisfied.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.720
You've all worked hard
to prepare for this project.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.190
Everyone will have good news,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.500
so just look forward to it.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.890
Will we get promoted?

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.460
Or will we get bonuses?

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.540
Then how about grilled pork belly
and soju today?

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.840
Goodness.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.930
We should eat beef on a day like this.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.320
Am I right?

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.720
Come on.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.670
Did you hear that?

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.020
No one is allowed to be absent.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.170
Everyone, come.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.620
Oh, Seo Jeonghan.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.039
I heard the guy who works
at the cafe downstairs

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.470
is your cousin.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.890
Bring him along.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.360
I'll treat you to very expensive beef.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.560
All right, let's head
to the barbecue restaurant. Go, go!

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.970
But Iljo didn't come to work today.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.759
He didn't come to work today?

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.539
Don't you live together?

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.580
I heard he had to go to the hospital.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.200
The owner opened the cafe late today, too.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.090
Let's go.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.910
Seo Jeonghan!

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.110
Seo Jeongin.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.760
Why are you here?

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.050
To see my uncle.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.360
What for?

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.200
Why are you being so distant?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.600
Leave if you're done.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.620
Have you been in touch

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.780
with that rascal Lee Iljo?

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.650
I heard he's working here.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.780
I don't know.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.600
What a loser.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.960
What are you doing?

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.380
It's you, right?

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.520
Seo Jeongin.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.100
Damn, am I that famous?

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.740
Stop threatening Lee Iljo.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.130
Is Lee Iljo

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.410
your...

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.110
How ridiculous.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.460
So he has a new partner already?

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.390
Are you cheating with him?

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.680
Seo Jeonghan is going to get backstabbed.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.120
Wow.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.470
Stop it while I'm still being nice.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.500
If Seo Jeonghan finds out

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.210
you're threatening Iljo,
it's going to be over for you.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.390
What are you talking about?

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.930
It's going so well only because
Jeonghan's helping.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.680
Don't you know?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.000
Our family's business is quite systematic.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.029
Go tell Iljo

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.829
to stop pestering the Seo family.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.230
Where's Iljo?

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.890
Oh, he did all the tests.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.440
He took some painkillers and is sleeping.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.170
Is it because of the gallbladder surgery?

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.800
No, I don't think so.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.020
Well...

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.300
Shoot.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.200
I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.580
Has Iljo

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.730
been getting beaten up?

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.600
He keeps getting wounded.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.120
Shouldn't we call the police?

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.140
Lee Iljo.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.270
What is all this?

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.310
Jeonghan.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.040
-I can explain.
-I'm asking you, what is all this!

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.700
It's Seo Jeongin, right?

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.620
You let him beat you up like this?

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.040
Are you stupid?

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.110
Why did you just let him beat you up?

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:54.659
This darn bastard...

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.840
If you ask me to do it,
I'll beat him up for you.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.260
I'll make him hurt more than you.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.630
I understand him.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.620
What?

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.340
He suddenly lost his dad.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.200
It's understandable that he hates me.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.430
Why did you hide it from me?

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.070
Why do I have to hear this
from someone else?

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.350
I'm sorry, Jeonghan.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.810
I'm nothing to you.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:37.960
It's not like that.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.540
You...

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.650
must've no idea what I went through

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.980
to decide on starting this relationship.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.970
What?

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.640
Seeing how I'm head over heels for you,

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.760
you think I'm a joke now?

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.990
How long are you going to do this to me?

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.050
I'm in so much pain because of you.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.090
Hey, Jeonghan.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.380
What?

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.540
Let's...

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.299
break up.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.780
You know what you're saying, right?

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.600
Yes.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.690
Why are you thinking
of breaking up with me?

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:51.970
Are you having fun playing me?

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.970
It's not like that.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.400
You must be having a great time
looking at how you have control over me.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.990
Jeonghan.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.660
How long
have you been thinking about this?

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.720
Here I am saying that I'd take revenge
on the bastard who is torturing you.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.120
Yet you're hurting me.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.340
Huh?

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.960
You want to break up?

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.140
Jeongin knows.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.520
About what?

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.520
That I live with you.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.050
So?

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.430
Also that...

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.170
I like you.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.600
Don't worry.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.920
I said it was one-sided.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.280
Don't worry?

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.820
Do you think I'm someone who'd be worried
about that at this point in time?

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.010
I just need to kill that bastard, right?

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.770
That's all I need to do, right?

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.080
Darn it!

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.160
-Jeonghan!
-That darn bastard!

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:09.910
Jeonghan!

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:10.910
Jeonghan, don't do that.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.080
-Jeonghan!
-Let me go, darn it!

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.270
Jeonghan!

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.120
Jeonghan!

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.110
Jeonghan, please stop!

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.360
Please stop! Jeonghan, please.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.580
Please stop, Jeonghan.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.740
Don't you dare say nonsense
like that again.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.830
If I stay by your side,
you'll keep getting hurt.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.130
I won't get hurt just because of this.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.790
I was just whining

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.110
when I said it gives me pain.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.580
So...

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.980
I'm the one in pain, Jeonghan.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.360
I'm sorry.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.240
I'm in so much pain.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.750
I was happy when I was by my dad,

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.170
but I was also so unlucky
I wanted to die.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.230
I felt like
I was my dad's only misfortune.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:29.480
Jeonghan, I don't want to become
my loved one's misfortune again.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.000
But you didn't leave.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.230
You stood by Uncle's side.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.270
So why are you leaving me?

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.340
I'm sorry for making you suffer.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.970
I...

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.800
Maybe I like you too much,
so I got greedy.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.720
I think this is all my fault.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.530
It really...

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.430
doesn't hurt me at all.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.910
You're not my misfortune, either.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.510
I'd be more misfortunate without you.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.050
No matter what happens,
I will be by your side.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.550
I promise.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.420
Jeonghan.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.880
It's difficult for me.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.290
Please...

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.030
Let's just break up.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:16.130
Hey, don't drink so much.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.090
You're drunk.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.990
Get your hands off me.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.010
Darn it.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.100
Have some snacks.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.150
I told you to drink less.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.880
Darn it.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.210
Here.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.630
Oh?

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.630
You're here to drink alcohol for me?

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.400
Are you on drugs again?

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.330
Let's go for a smoke.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.900
What are you doing?

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.770
You bastard!

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.060
Darn it.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.650
You bastard!

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.410
Bastard!

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.430
Darn it.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.560
Darn it.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.470
What the hell are you doing?

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.140
Shut your mouth and smoke.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.040
Hey, Seo Jeonghan!

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.590
Hey!

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.030
What are you doing?

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.860
Come to your senses!

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.080
You crazy jerk!

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:43.370
Stop acting pitiful.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.600
Darn it. This is nothing
compared to what you've done.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.300
Did Lee Iljo seduce you?

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.040
How the hell did you fall for him?

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.080
Shut up.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.830
I saw how he acted innocent
taking care of my dad.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.500
But every moment he got,
he'd stick right onto you in the hospital.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.570
-I told you to shut up—
-Hey.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.540
It's so obvious.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.960
Lee Iljo seduced you, didn't he?

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.840
But what to do?

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.560
He fooled around with me a lot.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.270
Bastard.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.340
He's still giving others head nowadays.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.950
Seo Jeonghan.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.620
You were fooled, you jerk!

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.340
Bastard!

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.050
Bastard!

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.700
Darn it.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:52.480
I saw how he acted innocent
taking care of my dad.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.250
But every moment he got,
he'd stick right onto you in the hospital.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.130
But what to do?

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.020
He fooled around with me a lot.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.270
You were fooled.

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:07.400
Darn it.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.290
Darn it.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.760
Mr. Seo wants to see you.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:55.660
I told you to keep a low profile
before you take over the company.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.210
It's just a quarrel between cousins.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.250
It's nothing big.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.910
Don't you know how hard those people
are trying to find dirt on you?

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.600
But they never did.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.200
Lee Iljo.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.040
Don't get too close to him.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.040
It's for your own good.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.480
There's nothing wrong

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.020
with cousins being close.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:30.050
Jeongin won't easily bet
on a game that he's destined to lose.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.700
He definitely has something on you.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.850
But I don't know what that is yet.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.580
So,

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.890
I'm going to get rid of every weakness
you might have.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.590
He's the first one.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.200
He's not my weakness.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:56.910
If you have nothing more to say,

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.390
I'll get going.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.690
Seo Jeonghan!

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.710
You don't seem to understand,
so in other words,

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.950
it's not for your own good,

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.700
but for his own good.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.560
Don't touch him.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.020
If you dare,

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.100
I won't let you off easily.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.600
Be smart.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.380
Misfortune will fall upon many people.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.140
Just because of you.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.130
I've been waiting for you
to come back to say goodbye.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.380
What's wrong? What happened to your face?

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.430
Did Seo Jeongin do it?

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.480
Did you fight?

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:56.070
Iljo... Is dating me a misfortune to you?

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.060
What are you talking about?

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.480
Answer me.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.740
I've never not been happy

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.180
because of you, Jeonghan.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:14.840
That's all I need to know.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.120
I'm ready...

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.460
to be with you for a long time.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:24.780
What about you?

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.440
I can easily support you.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.890
So from now on, just do what you like,

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.150
and care about what you like.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:52.760
I don't want to be your weakness.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.530
I'm going to get rid of every weakness
you might have.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.460
He's the first one.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.960
You're not my weakness.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.990
So stop saying
that you're my misfortune or weakness.

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.030
I've completely fallen for you.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.430
Lee Iljo.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.140
You and I...

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.180
can't just be like that anymore.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.310
But you have a future.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.920
A future more important than me.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.130
Compared to that stupid future,
I prefer the future with you.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:40.030
So just answer me.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:43.440
I'm not as kind as you think.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.060
There's something I couldn't tell you.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.660
What is it?

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.800
You must think I lied to you.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.720
I know.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.600
What?

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.970
I said I know everything, too—

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:05.210
that you slept with Seo Jeongin.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:09.170
But I don't mind.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.520
Whether you slept with Seo Jeongin

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.300
or fooled around with a few people
in Uncle's hospital—

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.740
I'm telling you I don't mind.
So why are you being like this?

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:30.980
Lee Iljo.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.210
Stop right there.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.840
If you walk out now,
it's really over for us.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.990
It'd really be over!

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.160
Welcome...

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.940
You know where Lee Iljo is, right?

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.240
I don't.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.740
Isn't he at your house?

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.100
How I hope so.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.910
If I file a police report,
we'll find out everything.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.960
Before you embarrass yourself,

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.040
tell me where Iljo is.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.010
Bye.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.480
Sorry,

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.880
that was rude of me.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.580
After he left,

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.790
I got so nervous that I was going crazy.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.750
I thought if he were at your house,

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.900
I might be more at ease.

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:06.310
I won't force him to see me.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.480
Just tell me where he is.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.180
Let's sit down and talk.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.840
How sincere are you?

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.270
What do you mean?

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:24.420
Why is it Iljo?

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.910
Huh?

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.760
Why him?

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.590
As your partner.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.620
Must there be a reason to like someone?

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.760
Don't you know it might hurt him?

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:44.490
I promised him
that no matter what happens,

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.690
I'll be by his side.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.650
No.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:50.890
You're not able to do that.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:56.600
After all, other than Iljo,
you have way too many things to protect.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.990
So leave Iljo be.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.610
Well...

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.090
If you see him,

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.770
please contact me.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.790
Please.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.880
Mr. Seo Jeonghan.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.630
What?

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:41.000
Is my dad asking you to keep an eye on me?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.090
I have something to tell you.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:50.080
Mr. Seo wants you to move up
to a directorial position now.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.610
He said you should start shouldering
the future of the company.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.820
But you have a future.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.280
I don't want to be your weakness.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:08.710
I'm going to get rid of every weakness
you might have.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.560
You met Iljo, right?

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.840
I'm asking you. You met him, right?

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.250
I'm sorry.

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:20.460
I can't tell you.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.640
What did you say?

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.380
Did you threaten him?

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.060
What do you mean?

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:33.960
Please let go. We're in the office.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:45.490
For the past nine years,
he was sincere towards the Seo family.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:47.980
Mr. Seo ordered me

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.600
to give him a sum of money

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.120
as compensation.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.740
Did he accept it?

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.380
Yes.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.560
The sum of money I gave to him
is to his satisfaction,

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.290
so he accepted it.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.190
When I first mentioned it to him,
he said he would consider it.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:04.830
When I called him a few days ago,

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.500
he agreed.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.340
Looks like you've been in touch
for a long time,

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.740
the two of you.

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.180
He could have gotten a lot of money
from me.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:25.080
Why did he choose such a difficult path?

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.080
I think you misunderstood.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.340
This is clearly a settlement between us.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.770
Your relationship
won't do the two of you any good.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.380
Just go.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:03.900
[Iljo, I'm sorry.]

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.620
[I'm sorry for everything.]

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.500
[It's my fault.]

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.380
[I failed to protect you.]

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.540
[I'll be good to you.]

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.660
[Iljo, I can't live without you.]

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:31.180
[Lee Iljo:
I never slept with Seo Jeongin.]

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.340
[In the next episode]

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.330
I didn't move out because I was angry.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.400
I just didn't want to see you anymore.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.370
I want to break up with you.

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:49.080
I'm not done yet.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.360
Don't you know
that Iljo is being threatened?

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.590
Is it really none of your business?

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:56.900
His name came out
of that filthy Seo Jeongin's mouth.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:00.140
Seo Jeongin...
