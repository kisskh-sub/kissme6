[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 18]

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.230
You've committed a grave crime
and still want to be released.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.960
I am your father.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.840
Did you ever think I was your daughter
when you poisoned me?

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.150
And besides,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.270
Su Qingran is already dead.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.750
Yet you still blame me.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.190
Ten years ago, I sent you
to the countryside.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.630
That was because
your grandmother was muddle-headed.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.190
She didn't listen to your explanation.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.040
If back then

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.000
you had just spoken to me honestly,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.070
how could I have not believed you?

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.440
You still don't know

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.550
where exactly you went wrong.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.320
You unfilial daughter,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.960
put the knife down at once.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.440
Are you planning to kill your father?

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.150
Unfilial daughter?

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.150
You couldn't even recognize
your own daughter.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.710
And you expect others
to fulfill this filial duty?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.710
Su Guang,

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.480
look closely.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.750
Am I truly your daughter?

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.230
You...

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.150
You personally abandoned Su Qingran
in the countryside.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.520
And your favored concubine, Gong Xi,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.110
colluded with your confidant
Ye Changyuan,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.800
selling her off to Begonia House.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.150
She suffered for years
and was cruelly mistreated until death.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.920
You are the one

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.920
who set all this in motion.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.590
She has been waiting for you
to bring her home.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.550
But she never came back before she died.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.630
She hated you.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.230
She hated everyone in the Su Family.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.590
You don't deserve to be her father.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.710
I...

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.440
I only wanted to discipline her.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.070
I never meant for her to die.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.550
Who... who are you?

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.000
Me?

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.270
I am the daughter of Wen Muchen,
former Governor of Yunzhou City,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.040
Wen Yueqian.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.550
It was you and Wanyan Lie,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.440
who conspired to poison the Qilin Army

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.750
and framed my father.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.800
You caused my father's wrongful death.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.070
If you hand over the account book
with Wanyan Lie's crimes,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.630
I might spare your life today.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.000
How do you know about the account book?

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.400
Wanyan Jin told you?

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.440
If you want to keep a secret,

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.800
you must not do the deed.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.440
Where is the book?

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.960
Do you think I'd hand over

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.000
what keeps me alive so easily?

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.230
I will not tell you.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.520
Let's see how long you can keep it.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.440
Lord Bai Ling.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.110
I'll give you one more night.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.070
Your Highness, Su Guang
committed suicide out of guilt.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.520
Who came here?

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.670
The crown princess came.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.710
She? Could it be her?

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.750
Or was it someone else?

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.880
Your Highness.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.000
Has everything been dealt with?

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.270
Everything was handled as you ordered.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.750
Your Highness.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.480
Speak your mind.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.400
Your Highness,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.550
I beg you to save my life.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.520
I did so many dirty deeds
for you all these years.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.840
My loyalty was absolute.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.670
Even without merit,
I deserve some credit.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.230
Hmph.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.110
You still have the nerve to ask me?

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.960
Su Guang,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.670
I really underestimated you.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.480
You're bold enough

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.320
to smuggle black gunpowder.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.670
You expect me to save you?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.960
Don't be ridiculous.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.110
Your Highness,

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.270
for you,

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.840
I poisoned the entire Qilin Army.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.700
Go fetch the wine quickly.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.400
Yes.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.880
Su Guang,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.580
you can be careless with your food,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.960
but not with your words.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.880
What do I have to do
with the Qilin Army

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.920
and you?

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.550
Your Highness,

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.520
since you never did it,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.960
I suppose you didn't care

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.360
when Wen Muchen's account book

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.880
was placed before the Emperor.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.190
Didn't you already destroy
the account book?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.150
Your Highness,

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.590
everyone fears death.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.000
If you save me,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.400
the account book will never
be made public.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.000
Fine.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.550
I will save you.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.880
Wanyan Lie,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.960
the account book is still in my hands.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.070
I can find it

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.480
but I do not

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.520
trust your tongue at all.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.190
Let's go.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.660
Come with me to the Su Mansion.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.360
Yes.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.400
[Benefit the People]

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.100
Conduct a thorough search of Su Mansion.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.920
Every corner

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.060
must be inspected carefully.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.000
If there is anything suspicious,

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.480
hand it over to me immediately.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.230
Yes.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.760
[Suoqing Palace]

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.320
Su Guang committed suicide.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.670
Wanyan Lie set fire to Su Mansion.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.920
He probably didn't find it.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.040
Wanyan Jin has been
interrogating Su Guang.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.440
Could it be that he broke
Su Guang's silence early

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.880
and got the account book?

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.480
Your Highness,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I heard

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.750
Su Guang took his own life in prison.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.750
Since our cooperation went well,

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.360
how about we share a drink together?

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.750
I fear your intention lies not
in the wine.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.440
Why wouldn't it be?

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.670
Today we speak only of romance,
not of mundane affairs.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.110
I salute you. Let's not leave
until we're drunk.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.270
Your tolerance is really low.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.330
With one pot of wine,
you're already drunk.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:12.710
She was looking for the account book.
So the one who took it isn't her.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.310
But where exactly did Wanyan Jin
hide the account book?

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.000
Why did I search the whole house
but still couldn't find it?

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.150
Could it be that he never took it?

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:30.680
Could it be that Wanyan Lie
really burn it in that fire?

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.760
It's a futile effort.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.350
After all that trouble,
I still failed to find it.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.920
Then just have a drink.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.840
My head feels so dizzy.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.560
Trying to steal a chicken
but losing the rice.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.680
You wanted to get me drunk,

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.350
but you got drunk in the end.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.350
I'm not drunk.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.310
Could it be that when she's drunk,
she answers questions in reverse?

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.040
Am I your husband?

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.040
No.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.960
Are you

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.190

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:24.160
No.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.630
Then you really are Wen Yueqian.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:29.160
Do you

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:30.840

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.630
No, I don't.
