00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:47.780
I reported it to the police

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.520
to lawfully prevent

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.050
a Tanka from coming ashore.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.150
Alright, alright, settle down.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.080
It's not a big amount after all.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.180
Miss Qiao,

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.570
look, here's what we can do:

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.070
let's just pretend this young girl
never came.

[Qiao Yinwan, Young Violinist]

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.070
I'll make up her donation—

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.320
I'll contribute ten times the amount.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:10.950
You two,

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.420
take the girl back to her boat right now.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:12.920
Wait!

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.460
Dr. Lok Pak,

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.900
this isn't about the money.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.950
This is
about this Chinese girl's dignity,

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.190
and about the patriotism
of all Tanka fishermen.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.040
Today, I must take this donation,

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.640
and no one is taking her away.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.530
That's right—

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.170
she really can't leave.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:26.470
[Gonçalves, Inspector General
of the Macau Police Department]

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.610
Mr. Suzuki,
just what are you trying to do?

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.420
Since the police have confirmed

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.310
that this Tanka individual
came ashore illegally,

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.450
the money in her hands
naturally constitutes illegal funds.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.350
I demand

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.090
the police immediately confiscate
all donated funds,

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.590
conduct a full investigation,

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:41.520
and deal with the offender

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.540
according to the law.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.280
No way!

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.350
Our event

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.470
was officially approved
by the Macau government.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.880
I now believe the Japanese

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.310
are making a mountain

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.310
out of a molehill here—

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.690
twisting the situation
and causing trouble.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:53.810
Inspector General Gonçalves,

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.180
if in broad daylight

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.940
your Portuguese-Macau police refuse
to enforce the law

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.230
and openly indulge
and shield the Chinese,

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.330
then we Japanese

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.020
will also no longer abide

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.850
by any of Macau's laws and regulations
from now on.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.700
Mr. Liang,

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.540
I apologize for what happened today.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.920
Since the police have received a report,

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.070
the fundraising must be suspended.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.810
Please hand over the donations
to the police

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.830
for temporary confiscation;
they will be returned after verification.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.330
Stop our fundraising?

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
By what right
do you stop our fundraising?

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:21.990
What right?

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:23.550
This makes no sense at all!

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.850
I'm sorry, I never thought
it would come to this.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:27.760
It's all my fault.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.540
I won't come ashore again,

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.540
never again.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.970
Please don't confiscate
so many people's donations.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.440
So now you regret it?

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.470
Who told you Chinese
to lose your own country's territory?

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.680
You think you're worthy
of loving your country

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.610
here in Macau?

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:42.710
Here, hold this.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:43.600
Hey, Xian,

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:44.690
don't be rash!

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.020
Wait!

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.570
Officer,

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.800
I'd like to ask:

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.940
on what basis do you claim
this young lady

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.270
came ashore illegally?

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.140
Wasn't it just explained?

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.730
According to Macau custom.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.070
Then let me ask this:

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:04.800
in Macau,

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.850
which carries greater weight—

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:06.850
custom or the law?

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:08.170
The law, of course.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.330
But Macau's law

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.160
has no specific provision on this matter.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.440
But Macau has commercial law.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.310
And that law states that,

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:14.560
as an international free port,

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.900
anyone coming to Macau
to engage in international activities—

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.450
regardless of nationality, gender,

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:19.400
age, or status—

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.930
may enter and leave freely.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.170
Isn't that correct?

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.090
That is indeed true.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.150
But that applies to businesspeople.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.310
What does that have to do with this?

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.440
Everything—

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.520
because

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.100
she is my client.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.160

to obtain a financial services license.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.910

in financial activities

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:48.630
in Macau,

such as stocks, securities,

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.260
and currency exchange,
effective immediately.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.320
Please take a look.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.940
It appears valid.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:58.280

everything that follows,

but as long as you agree
to entrust this money to me,

the police here

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.880
won't dare confiscate these donations.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.450
be able to enter Macau
with your head held high—

in business activities in Macau.

Under Macau's law,

she has the right to enter and leave.

what financial service
has she commissioned you to handle?

I must remind you—

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.180
fabricating a non-existent
business transaction

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.040
is also a violation of Macau's law.

placing an order to trade forex.

doesn't it?

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.640
turns out your Harvard Ph.D. in finance

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:42.550
doesn't even rank here in Hong Kong.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:43.180
[Qiao Renyu, Chief Accountant of HSBC]

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:43.860
Hmm?

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.440
You don't know finance.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.800
How can you even judge someone's level?

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:52.320
There are so many scammers
in this industry—

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.160
you sure you weren't tricked by someone?

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.360
Don't brush it off.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:56.710
The guy I met

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.470
took a few thousand dollars scraped
together on the spot to trade forex,

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:00.990
and in just half an hour,

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:03.850
made the Japanese side lose
nearly a hundred grand.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.750
Something like that really happened?

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:15.250
Grandpa.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.100
Father,

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:17.290
I'm back.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.860
Let us offer incense.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:38.890
Descendant of the He family,

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.100
He Xian, present.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:41.510
Here.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.600
Speak truthfully

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:45.230
before our forebears.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.190
In your dealings today,

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.690
was there any dishonesty in business?

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:52.900
None whatsoever.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.420
Did you break any promises?

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:57.380
I kept every promise.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:59.450
In all other matters,

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:02.620
have you acted in a way
worthy of our ancestors' teachings

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.140
and your own conscience?

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.600
I, He Xian, have acted

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.750
within my duties

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.780
and with a clear conscience.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.520
Is everything you said true?

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.790
If I were making it up,
I couldn't spin a tale this legendary.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:42.900
Fair enough.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.620
With the sudden shift
in the Soviet-German war situation,

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:48.840
hardly any financial experts—

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.940
not just in Hong Kong but worldwide—

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.680
could've predicted it.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.080
Hmm.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.210
This Mr. He predicted it that accurately,

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.470
right down to the timing?

00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:59.420
Exactly..

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.330
And to be so bold right

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.680
in front of the Japanese—

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.710
daring and sharp.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.440
But how come

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.719
I've never heard
of such a remarkable colleague?

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:12.090
On the boat back to Hong Kong,

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:13.610
someone who knew him mentioned

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:14.949
his Huilong Bank

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:17.219
has only been open for three years
in Hong Kong.

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:20.350
Of course, it's nothing compared
to HSBC's reputation.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:22.590
In that case,

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:23.850
it really goes to show—

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.570
heroes can emerge from anywhere,

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:26.830
and greatness isn't measured by pedigree.

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:27.620
Exactly.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.300
A talent like that—

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.230
I'd love to meet him someday.

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:32.670
Sure.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.530
We're all in Hong Kong,

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.719
and he's so passionate about benefit shows
for the Resistance.

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:38.949
Next time there's an event
for the Resistance,

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:39.570
I'll invite him.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:40.900
I'm sure he'll come.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:43.400
Yinwan,

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:45.949
speaking of these Resistance events—

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:47.940
could we maybe reduce…

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.630
Could we maybe reduce
how much I appear in public,

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:50.550
right?

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:51.940
Every time I join an event like that,
you try to stop me—

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.010
over and over—

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:54.300
and you never succeed.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:55.960
Isn't that tiring?

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.400
I'm genuinely worried about your safety.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.070
You know what the Japanese
are capable of.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:02.590
Don't think just
because Hong Kong and Macau

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:04.150
are under foreign control now,

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:05.950
they won't dare act recklessly.

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:07.340
In just the past few years,

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.320
how many resistance figures
have vanished—

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.710
kidnapped, assassinated, bombed?

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.760
You're fine as you are—

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.440
why provoke them?

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.740
Provoke them?

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.950
Half our country is already

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.280
occupied by the Japanese!

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.400
As a Chinese person,

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.700
promoting resistance
and national salvation—

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.070
and you call that provoking them?

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:24.940
Alright,

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.110
I misspoke.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.470
Of course I know we must resist,

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:29.650
we must save the country—

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:32.260
haven't I donated every single time?

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.530
But soldiers fight on the front lines,

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.050
officials handle governance in the rear—

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.290
what difference can you,

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.350
a violinist, make?

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:39.800
And besides,

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:41.190
these past two years,

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.170
doing benefit tours near home

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:44.170
was one thing,

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.030
but you've gone to Southeast Asia,

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.550
the U.S.—

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.470
running all over the world.

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:50.450
What are you trying to do?

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:52.420
I'm rallying overseas Chinese

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.260
to donate for national salvation.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.200
One thing's clear—

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.230
no more of these tours from now on.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:00.250
At most, I'll just donate
more money next time.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:01.990
If everyone thought like you,

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:04.320
our country would have perished already.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.570
No courage yourself,
and now you won't let me go?

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:07.280
Next time—

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.150
a hundred times from now—I'll still go!

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.930
You—

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:11.260
What are you doing?

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:11.990
Sorry, sorry,

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.740
I didn't mean to.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:13.200
Yinwan.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.470

by selling out our country to the enemy,

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.450
what should be done?

Kill! Kill! Kill!

led the way in turning traitor.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.200
The punishment is three stabs, six wounds.

The rest will each lose an arm

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.360

But several lives from Jie's family,
three generations,

were lost for the Tai Ho Brotherhood.

Give him a chance to live.

but punishment cannot.

as the leader in turning traitor,

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.150
it's all my fault

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:13.650
for not teaching you right.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.240
From now on,

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:16.860
I'll provide for you.

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:18.740
Nobody move!

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:19.420
Grandpa!

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:20.530
Zixia!

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:21.920
Zixia!

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:25.090
Huang Gongjie, you bastard!

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.070
The Fifth Master kindly pleaded for you.

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:27.720
Pleaded for me?

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.360
Is that how you plead for someone?

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.320
After pleading, he still cut
off both my arms?

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.720
What are you all standing around for?
Move!

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.970
If I'm going down,

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.470
I'm taking someone with me!

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:39.340
with me!

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.110
Grandpa!

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:41.400
Stay back!

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.400
Everyone back!

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:43.780
Make way!

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:44.650
Let's move!

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:45.700
Grandpa!

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:06.030
Xian,

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.220
what's your plan now?

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:11.730
Are we really going to Macau?

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:13.900
Surely the Japanese

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.440
won't actually push into Hong Kong?

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.800
Tens of thousands of Japanese troops
are stationed across the Shenzhen River—

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.380
surely not just for show.

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:28.300
After all, Hong Kong is
in British possession.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:30.950
They've been shouting about attacking

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:32.450
for over half a year now,

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:34.180
and nothing's happened so far.

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:35.780
Honestly,

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.720
compared to Hong Kong,

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.780
Macau is just a small place—
not quite on the same level.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.290
Haven't I said that before?

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:45.780
Not moving now.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:46.740
With elderly parents

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.340
and young kids in the family,

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.650
we still need to keep a way out open.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:55.640
Let's just hope

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.950
Hong Kong stays peaceful

00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.370
and nothing happens.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.020
Let's hope so, anyway.

Something big—

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:25.110
something beyond
what we could have anticipated.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.360
Exactly.
