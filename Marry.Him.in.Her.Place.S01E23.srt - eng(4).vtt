00:05:02.132 --> 00:05:04.051

Lin Yun,

00:05:17.762 --> 00:05:19.870
What we have was a transaction
from the start.

00:05:20.692 --> 00:05:22.211
Once I avenge myself,

00:05:22.212 --> 00:05:23.692
and you get what you want,

00:05:23.962 --> 00:05:25.931
there will be nothing
between us anymore.

00:05:25.932 --> 00:05:27.251
(Without you,)

00:05:27.252 --> 00:05:29.052
(I can live just fine.)

00:05:29.572 --> 00:05:31.331
(We agreed not to interfere.)

00:05:31.332 --> 00:05:34.091
(Mr. Lin, you should follow
your own boundaries.)

00:05:34.092 --> 00:05:35.651
Have you ever,

00:05:35.652 --> 00:05:38.692
even for a moment, truly cared for me?

00:05:38.892 --> 00:05:40.291
I'm sorry, Lin Yun.

00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:42.331
My choice is

00:05:42.332 --> 00:05:43.852
to let you go.

00:05:46.452 --> 00:05:49.251

How were you so certain back then

that I would definitely acknowledge
Song Ming to save my life?

00:09:06.137 --> 00:09:08.645
Weren't you afraid I'd fall
into utter despair and only seek death?

00:09:10.687 --> 00:09:12.127
You wouldn't.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.110
You would only hate me.

00:09:14.652 --> 00:09:16.131
The more you hate me,

00:09:16.132 --> 00:09:19.172
the more you'd want to live,
just to take revenge on me.

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:20.905
Why are you so foolish?

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.490
Foolish enough to think I'd really
bear to take revenge on you?

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.372
I think you bore it just fine.

00:09:28.132 --> 00:09:29.572
That day at the Song Residence,

00:09:30.437 --> 00:09:32.424
you asked me if I was also acting.

00:09:32.425 --> 00:09:34.424
Song Ming was right outside the door.
Did you know?

00:09:34.425 --> 00:09:36.293
You almost got me killed.

00:09:38.512 --> 00:09:41.352
But at the moment you asked me,

00:09:41.725 --> 00:09:43.005
my heart warmed.

00:09:43.052 --> 00:09:46.632
Because it made me feel
that you still trusted me.

00:09:49.437 --> 00:09:51.061
So everything you did

00:09:51.062 --> 00:09:52.807
was to deceive Song Ming?

00:09:54.175 --> 00:09:55.495
Why?

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:58.762
Song Ming has been secretly colluding
with Yunzhou for a long time.

00:10:00.052 --> 00:10:01.120
The opium was merely

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.412
one of the channels he used
to funnel benefits to Yunzhou.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.190
What he wants is Yunzhou's
military force,

00:10:06.852 --> 00:10:08.657
to help him seize Jiangzhou.

00:10:09.892 --> 00:10:12.451
So you helped him amass money quickly

00:10:12.452 --> 00:10:15.070
just to push him into rebellion?

00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:16.245
Yes.

00:10:16.892 --> 00:10:19.261
But what if he really succeeded
in taking Jiangzhou?

00:10:19.262 --> 00:10:20.632
He won't succeed.

00:10:20.972 --> 00:10:22.611
Did you really think

00:10:22.612 --> 00:10:24.920
I'd hand that money to Yunzhou?

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:26.651
What I wanted

00:10:26.652 --> 00:10:29.520
was merely proof
of his exposed ambition.

00:10:33.212 --> 00:10:34.532
Lin Yun,

00:10:35.452 --> 00:10:36.772
promise me,

00:10:37.487 --> 00:10:41.047
let me deliver the final blow.

00:10:42.852 --> 00:10:45.091
The one who killed my father

00:10:45.092 --> 00:10:46.732
was Song Ming.

00:11:33.132 --> 00:11:34.172
Yi.

00:11:50.362 --> 00:11:51.602
Having porridge again?

00:11:52.412 --> 00:11:53.532
Again?

00:12:00.172 --> 00:12:02.449
Last time after we had porridge,
we separated.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.182
This time the flavor is different.

00:12:15.852 --> 00:12:17.292
You're like a dog.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.600
If you run off again,

00:12:22.732 --> 00:12:23.324
I'll...

00:12:23.325 --> 00:12:25.165
Are you bringing the chain
to lock me to the bed?

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:26.532
Would you bear to?

00:12:29.892 --> 00:12:31.651
Then swear it

00:12:31.652 --> 00:12:33.012
that you'll never leave me again.

00:12:33.612 --> 00:12:34.891
Alright.

00:12:34.892 --> 00:12:36.172
I swear.

00:12:37.012 --> 00:12:38.091
Unless...

00:12:38.092 --> 00:12:39.371
Unless I die.

00:12:39.372 --> 00:12:40.449
Liang Yi.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.245
I was just joking.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:43.931
I promise you,

00:12:43.932 --> 00:12:45.799
I'll live until all our teeth fall out,

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.707
and I'll keep pestering you, alright?

00:13:13.712 --> 00:13:15.752
Why must you go to Yunzhou?

00:13:17.292 --> 00:13:18.661
If I don't go,

00:13:18.662 --> 00:13:20.262
Song Ming will grow suspicious.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.020
What if Marshal Jin finds out?

00:13:24.172 --> 00:13:26.932
This is the arrangement
between me and Marshal Jin.

00:13:27.625 --> 00:13:29.585
You still need to stay cautious.

00:13:31.852 --> 00:13:33.091
When I left the Song Residence,

00:13:33.092 --> 00:13:34.451
did Song Ming get suspicious?

00:13:34.452 --> 00:13:35.692
No.

00:13:36.532 --> 00:13:38.549
I told him I had you locked up
by my side

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.107
and was torturing you hard.

00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:47.812
When are you leaving?

00:13:50.012 --> 00:13:51.092
The afternoon boat.

00:13:55.092 --> 00:13:56.720
Come with me to a place.

00:14:01.687 --> 00:14:02.824
This fabric suits me.

00:14:02.825 --> 00:14:04.225
I'll make you a summer shirt.

00:14:04.525 --> 00:14:06.485
Madam, you truly have good taste.

00:14:07.572 --> 00:14:09.652
The collar needs silver
cloud embroidery.

00:14:09.892 --> 00:14:10.972
Noted.

00:14:13.692 --> 00:14:16.012
The waist shouldn't be made too wide.

00:14:16.172 --> 00:14:17.412
You can do this too?

00:14:18.892 --> 00:14:21.332
I used to measure
all my father's clothes.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.040
Madam, please look here.

00:14:24.532 --> 00:14:25.491
Spring silk.

00:14:25.492 --> 00:14:26.571
Summer gauze.

00:14:26.572 --> 00:14:27.571
Autumn velvet.

00:14:27.572 --> 00:14:28.531
Winter fur.

00:14:28.532 --> 00:14:29.891
All are here.

00:14:29.892 --> 00:14:31.931
Yunzhou is spring all year round.

00:14:31.932 --> 00:14:34.371
You've prepared clothes
for all four seasons.

00:14:34.372 --> 00:14:36.172
What is all this for?

00:14:41.692 --> 00:14:43.571
You wear those black suits all the time.

00:14:43.572 --> 00:14:44.531
I'm sick of seeing them.

00:14:44.532 --> 00:14:46.612
Naturally, these are for you
to wear in the future.

00:14:48.492 --> 00:14:49.852
I should go.

00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:51.832
Be good and wait for me to come back.

00:15:07.292 --> 00:15:08.570
Safe travels.

00:15:23.812 --> 00:15:25.292
Mr. Lin.

00:15:25.372 --> 00:15:27.680
Governor Song ordered that you
don't need to go to Yunzhou.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.291
Please come with us.

00:15:29.292 --> 00:15:31.972
Let's go.

00:15:43.237 --> 00:15:44.971
What are you doing?

00:15:44.972 --> 00:15:46.451
No need to go to Yunzhou.

00:15:46.452 --> 00:15:47.771
Good son.

00:15:47.772 --> 00:15:49.131
Don't worry about it.

00:15:49.132 --> 00:15:50.931
Yunzhou's troops have already
entered Rong City.

00:15:50.932 --> 00:15:52.331
Too bad.

00:15:52.332 --> 00:15:54.172
Your performance failed.

00:15:57.812 --> 00:15:59.674
You said you were going
to Yunzhou in my place.

00:15:59.675 --> 00:16:01.899
Were you planning to take my life?

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.131
Tell me, was ancestral grave
of the Song family chosen wrong?

00:16:05.132 --> 00:16:08.091
One son reckless and stupid at birth,

00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:09.731
and then you,

00:16:09.732 --> 00:16:11.291
a dagger hidden at the end.

00:16:11.292 --> 00:16:14.492
Scheming every day to kill your old man.

00:16:17.492 --> 00:16:20.732
You hid something inside the banner.
Don't think I don't know.

00:16:22.512 --> 00:16:23.251
(Proof)

00:16:23.252 --> 00:16:26.451
With this proof,
come to Chengyun Society in a month,

00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:28.724
and reclaim all the property
on the donation agreement.

00:16:28.725 --> 00:16:29.852
The deeds.

00:16:34.812 --> 00:16:36.851
One month.

00:16:36.852 --> 00:16:39.611
You calculated it perfectly.

00:16:39.612 --> 00:16:41.761
You're waiting for me to be dead,

00:16:41.762 --> 00:16:43.449
then return everything to you.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.011
Will Yunzhou give it back to you?

00:16:46.012 --> 00:16:48.571
When their troops surround Jiangzhou,

00:16:48.572 --> 00:16:50.411
do you think they'll agree?

00:16:50.412 --> 00:16:51.972
Who will surround it?

00:16:52.412 --> 00:16:54.511
Your Chengyun Society?

00:16:54.512 --> 00:16:55.832
Tell me, who?

00:16:56.132 --> 00:16:58.172
A treacherous minister
starts a rebellion,

00:16:58.692 --> 00:17:00.011
who will suppress it?

00:17:00.012 --> 00:17:03.052
So you've already colluded
with Marshal Jin in secret.

00:17:04.125 --> 00:17:05.925
Planning to join forces to eliminate me.

00:17:09.562 --> 00:17:11.371
Cruel enough.

00:17:11.372 --> 00:17:13.531
A small-time gangster like you,

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:16.851
Marshal Jin is probably
being played by you as well.

00:17:16.852 --> 00:17:19.691
You want to borrow someone else's knife

00:17:19.692 --> 00:17:21.892
to kill your own father, right?

00:17:22.132 --> 00:17:23.531
It seems

00:17:23.532 --> 00:17:26.092
you are even more ruthless than Zhichu.

00:17:29.052 --> 00:17:32.411
Tell me, what have I been
fighting for half my life?

00:17:32.412 --> 00:17:34.052
What's the point?

00:17:36.692 --> 00:17:37.932
Meaningless.

00:17:39.372 --> 00:17:41.611
Even if I become Marshal,

00:17:41.612 --> 00:17:44.092
no one will take the position
of Young Marshal.

00:17:45.132 --> 00:17:46.492
Marshal?

00:17:48.452 --> 00:17:50.812
You think you deserve it?

00:17:52.652 --> 00:17:55.371
Why did the Marshal's position
go to Jin back then,

00:17:55.372 --> 00:17:56.331
and not you?

00:17:56.332 --> 00:17:57.891
You really don't know?

00:17:57.892 --> 00:17:59.361
You didn't even dare
raise your own troops.

00:17:59.362 --> 00:18:01.971
You paid Yunzhou to buy soldiers.

00:18:01.972 --> 00:18:04.852
Aren't you afraid they'll swallow
you whole later?

00:18:05.012 --> 00:18:07.451
You let your son kill and burn for you,

00:18:07.452 --> 00:18:09.851
and when he died, you called him stupid.

00:18:09.852 --> 00:18:11.452
Song Ming.

00:18:12.037 --> 00:18:15.677
Your dream of being Marshal
is utterly ridiculous.

00:18:16.212 --> 00:18:17.772
Shut up!

00:18:22.362 --> 00:18:23.351
(Presented to Mr. Wang
Jiangzhou Honorary Citizen)

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:24.682
(Good Man of Rong City
By Lin Yun of Chengyun Society)

00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:29.411
Song Ming already sent the money
to Yunzhou long ago.

00:18:29.412 --> 00:18:32.092
They say Yunzhou's troops
have entered Rong City.

00:18:33.775 --> 00:18:35.807
Any news of Lin Yun and Song Ming?

00:18:36.172 --> 00:18:37.852
The boss's life or death is unknown.

00:18:39.572 --> 00:18:40.651
Break in!

00:18:40.652 --> 00:18:44.051
Rescue the boss!

00:18:44.052 --> 00:18:46.371
Song Ming won't fight to the death.

00:18:46.372 --> 00:18:49.211
He's not that determined.

00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:50.331
Everyone.

00:18:50.332 --> 00:18:51.331
Follow me.

00:18:51.332 --> 00:18:53.052
Yes, Madam Lin.

00:18:55.012 --> 00:18:56.132
Let's go!

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:12.172
