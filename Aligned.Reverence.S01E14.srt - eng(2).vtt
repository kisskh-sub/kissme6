(It was my selfish hope)

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.499
Yunxi.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.179
Yan.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.979
What is it?

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.420
Did something happen at home?

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.740
No.

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:37.182
I... I just feel that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.260
I owe you.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.580
No, I owe you.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.060
The weight of the Xiao family

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.420
has fallen on you alone.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.620
Right,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.380
how is the grain procurement going?

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.620
Very smoothly.

00:01:54.962 --> 00:01:56.299
Almost too smoothly.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.900
It makes me uneasy.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.379
Everyone in the family,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.860
especially...

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.060
They...

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.020
They are gambling everything

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.379
just for my future.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.500
I...

00:02:13.975 --> 00:02:15.136
I know.

00:02:15.137 --> 00:02:16.457
It's hard.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.620
But you must

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.220
hold on and keep going.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.860
Only then will you not fail
the one who cares most for you.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.140
All right.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.620
Since it's going well,

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.500
I'll contact our old retainers.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.580
They'll support you when needed.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.957
Go back now.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.020
Okay.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.939
(Yunyan, I know.)

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.500
(You won't let that person down.)

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.459
Young Madam. Your five shops
and the property in the west of the city

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.090
(Storage Room)
have all been converted to banknotes

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.660
and handed to Heir Qi for grain.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.040
However,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.320
the broker said when the shops were sold,
the Su mother and daughter came to inquire.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.720
They're stockpiling grain as well.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.619
My aunt has always been cunning.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.140
Let them stockpile if they want.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.059
Everyone, work hard tonight.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.259
Take turns keeping watch.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.739
All right.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.260
Make sure the grain doesn't get wet.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.340
Slow down.

00:03:47.337 --> 00:03:49.417
Why push yourself so hard?

00:03:51.012 --> 00:03:52.812
Here in the Xiao family,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.740
everyone treats me so well.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.620
I want to do more for them.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.620
And everything you do,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.195
isn't it also for me?

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.580
Little Yuan.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.299
Could it be

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.580
the coffin shop isn't doing well,

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.500
and you're planning
to support their business?

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.740
Physician Xi.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.780
Mind your tongue.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.579
Or else

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.180
you might get thrown out.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.460
Throw me out?

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.579
Fine.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.100
I'll leave then.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.139
I won't disturb you, Young Master Xie,

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.220
while you fawn over Little Yuan.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.332
(Feiwan Pavilion)

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:20.932
(Feiwan Pavilion)

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.780
Thanks for coming all this way with me.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.180
You're not going in?

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.940
Standing here like a stone
waiting for your wife?

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.700
I'll just take one look.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.500
Young Lady Xi,
thank you for your trouble.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.380
Please bring the medicine inside.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.259
This...

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.740
Third Sister-in-law
specially made this porridge for you.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:49.524
Drink it.

00:05:49.525 --> 00:05:50.660
And take your medicine.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.420
I understand.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.340
Just leave it here.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.060
I'll check the account book.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.807
Drink the porridge
while it's still warm.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.620
Okay.

00:06:25.137 --> 00:06:26.537
I'll go close the door.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.260
Yunxi.

00:06:48.687 --> 00:06:50.127
Since you're back,

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.395
why not go inside?

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.780
No need.

00:06:54.512 --> 00:06:56.392
I still can't show myself before her.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.980
Besides,

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.900
you're taking good care of her.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.220
It's because...

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.899
Because she caught a chill.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.419
I panicked at the time and...

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.460
I know.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.380
She's ill.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.900
You're just caring for her.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.380
Drink the medicine.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.219
If you ask me,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.045
your illness isn't only from the cold.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.740
It comes from your heart as well.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.980
What heart ailment could I have?

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.339
Is Young Master Xie

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.700
not the cause?

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.660
Do you take me for a fool?

00:07:49.787 --> 00:07:50.907
Ning.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.980
Don't speak recklessly.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.540
He's only my sixth younger brother.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.660
I cannot fail the Xiao family again.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.660
Then will you fail yourself instead?

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.580
Yunxi.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.860
It's all my fault.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.940
I was the one
who let foolish feelings grow. I...

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:19.860
Yan.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.740
Actually, I...

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.300
In any case,

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.620
Xiao Yunxi is already dead.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.820
The one living now

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:33.999
is merely

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.440
ashes rekindled
by Physician Xi's furnace.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.620
Yuan is a good girl.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.980
Take good care of her.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.980
If...

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.540
If it were possible,

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.699
I wish you could...

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.020
When we were young,

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.340
whenever I wanted something,

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.380
you always gave it to me.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.980
It's my fault.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.820
From today on,

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.859
I will never cross the line again.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.459
If...

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.260
Yan.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.460
If there's even the slightest chance,

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.980
I will never let her go so easily.

00:09:19.462 --> 00:09:20.582
Only...

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.180
If one day Xiao Yunxi truly returns,

00:09:25.525 --> 00:09:27.419
will you really feel at ease

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.180
being Yan's Sister-in-law?

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.659
This bracelet

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.900
was meant for Yunxi's wife.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.140
Yunxi would be happy to see it.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.899
Life is short.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.174
Youth slips away quickly.

00:09:59.175 --> 00:10:01.224
Never wrong yourself.

00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:02.785
And never wrong others.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:05.979
Yuan.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.380
Careful.

00:10:16.275 --> 00:10:17.355
Go check on her.

00:10:19.475 --> 00:10:20.835
All right.

00:10:25.675 --> 00:10:31.595
(Feiwan Pavilion)

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.460
Still just a child.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.660
You can't hide anything.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.820
What happened?

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.820
It's nothing.

00:10:49.962 --> 00:10:51.602
I just wasn't careful.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.619
Be careful when going in and out.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.340
Don't you know patients
can't catch cold?

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.870
Little Yuan.

00:11:01.087 --> 00:11:03.127
I've said everything I needed to say.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.339
The rest...

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.940
You should think about carefully.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.260
What did

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.100
she say?

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.900
No...

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.900
Nothing.

I have Physician Xi here
