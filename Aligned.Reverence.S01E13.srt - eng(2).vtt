00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.419
Jinyuan.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.539
Grandmother said

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.939
the weather is wonderful this year,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.939
so the harvest should be great.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.939
The flowers I planted

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.660
will bloom beautifully as well.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.579
Jinyuan, everything was fine.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.940
Why did it suddenly thunder?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.259
What is chastity worth compared to a life?
Look outside.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.595
People starve to death every day.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.886
If you sleep with
the landlord's foolish son,

00:01:56.887 --> 00:01:58.447
you could at least earn a meal.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.824
I won't.

00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:00.665
Move!

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.260
Go!

00:02:03.275 --> 00:02:04.660
- I don't want to!
- Hurry!

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.220
Quick!

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.819
(In the previous life,
it was not a good harvest year.)

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.659
(Two months later,)

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.020
(Liangzhou suffered severe drought.)

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.979
(Merchants raised prices viciously.)

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.640
(The land was filled
with famine corpses.)

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.699
Looks like it may rain.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.940
Let's head back first.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.740
How can it thunder on a clear day?

00:02:30.325 --> 00:02:31.765
Did it startle you?

00:02:33.662 --> 00:02:36.274
I heard the elders say
that when the heavens show signs,

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:37.682
a great disaster follows.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.099
If the northwest

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.619
really suffers drought,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.839
and with the treasury strained
by the Linchuan war,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.599
the court

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.819
might not have funds
or grain for relief.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.882
Mind your words.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.311
Such reckless talk of state affairs

00:02:49.312 --> 00:02:51.099
must never come from the Xiao family.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.340
I understand.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.599
We could ask someone
to inquire in secret

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.040
about the situation in the northwest,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.739
and quietly stockpile grain.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.939
If drought really happens,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.295
this grain could ease the urgent need.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.739
If it doesn't,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.859
we'll think of another way

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.645
and resell the grain elsewhere.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.770
The loss won't be too much.

00:03:10.587 --> 00:03:12.027
As for gathering information,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.640
I'll find a way.

00:03:15.012 --> 00:03:17.049
But the silver needed
for stockpiling grain

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.770
is no small amount.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.180
I'll persuade Grandmother.

00:03:27.962 --> 00:03:29.842
Sometimes I feel

00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:31.224
you seem as if you know

00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:33.105
what will happen in the future.

00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:37.865
Just like back then,

00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:39.945
when you foresaw

00:03:40.475 --> 00:03:42.635
the disaster
that befell the Xiao family.

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:51.387
It was only a guess.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.180
I didn't mean anything else.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.900
(If the military grain ledger
Feng Kui mentioned)

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.500
(is actually a private salt ledger,)

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.040
(and now that Father is dead,)

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.640
(the one behind all this
still hasn't let the Xiao family go,)

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.020
(then this ledger)

00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:28.825
(should have been hidden
by Father in Liangzhou.)

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.980
Investigate agricultural affairs
in Liangzhou.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.295
(Out on business,
will return within ten days. Xi)

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.939
Leaving without a word.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.500
Couldn't you at least tell me?

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.580
Do you not know how worried I was?

00:05:14.412 --> 00:05:18.095
(Xiao Manor)

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.739
Since the new year,

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.100
Liangzhou hasn't had a drop of rain.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.059
The newly-appointed Prefect
loves to show off.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.900
He hardly cares about the drought.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.749
I reviewed the records
of former Prefects

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.030
and their reports on famine years.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.300
Your suspicion

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.020
is very likely true.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.420
Then I'll begin stockpiling grain now.

00:05:36.725 --> 00:05:39.165
Grandmother has already
prepared all the documents.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.820
If this succeeds,

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.859
it will help relieve the drought crisis

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.700
and aid in the revival
of the Xiao family.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.699
(If Yan rises one step further,)

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.700
(perhaps,)

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.940
(there may be hope
in restoring the Xiao family's glory.)

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.860
Slow down.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.100
Put it here.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.540
Place this sack over there.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.380
Careful now.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.180
Set it on that side.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.339
Weren't you on duty?

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.700
Why are you back?

00:06:31.362 --> 00:06:33.024
The first batch arrived tonight.

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:34.586
I worried you'd be too tired,

00:06:34.587 --> 00:06:36.307
so I came early to help.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.700
It's you.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.749
Heir Qi.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.670
Why sneak into my Xiao Manor?

00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:23.339
I heard

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.700
someone has been secretly
buying up grain.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.540
Though through many channels,

00:07:28.675 --> 00:07:31.155
they all lead back to one place.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.420
Why are you hoarding grain in secret?

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.980
Because I want to.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.220
Because I like it.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.220
Is that not allowed?

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.820
Such large-scale hoarding
is a serious crime.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.740
Yan.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.780
You'd better tell me the truth.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.499
Otherwise

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.380
I'll report you to His Majesty.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.059
I'm the one hoarding grain,

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.380
he has nothing to do with it.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.139
(Storage Room)

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.139
What did you say?

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.700
There will be drought in the northwest?

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.911
How dare you hide such news.

00:08:14.912 --> 00:08:16.552
There will be drought.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.819
If I report it now,

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.340
they'll say I'm spreading rumors.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.300
I know others less,

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.020
but I know you.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.699
If you weren't certain
drought was coming,

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.900
would you do this?

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.180
You could have reported it openly.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.300
Yet you chose to hoard grain in private.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.460
I suppose

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.860
this was your idea?

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.660
Are you planning to profit
from the nation's crisis?

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.020
Heir Qi.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.659
Have you considered

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.859
this could also stabilize grain prices?

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.540
Not everyone
has a mind as deep as yours.

00:08:58.637 --> 00:09:00.237
I believe that's what you think.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.940
But you,

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.420
is she truly doing this
for relief efforts

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.500
and nothing more?

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.540
What do you mean by that?

00:09:18.562 --> 00:09:20.259
Of course it's for disaster relief.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.736
If I wanted money,

00:09:21.737 --> 00:09:23.817
why would I go through all this trouble?

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.540
So then,

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.580
I suspect Young Lady Su has other aims.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.939
For example, when disaster strikes,

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.300
you could use the grain as leverage.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.260
And help Yan rise swiftly to success.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.100
Young Lady Su,

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.140
am I wrong?

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:53.724
We hoard grain

00:09:53.725 --> 00:09:55.085
for the nation and the people.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.470
I seek a little benefit
for the Xiao family,

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.820
it harms no greater cause.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.260
Why shouldn't I?

00:10:02.197 --> 00:10:04.036
You speak of profit
with such righteousness.

00:10:04.037 --> 00:10:05.357
Why not?

00:10:05.965 --> 00:10:07.374
Even if Your Lordship knows

00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:08.935
the Xiao family was wronged,

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:10.024
you weighed the risks

00:10:10.025 --> 00:10:11.385
and protected yourself.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.180
Now you ask why I do this?

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.419
I do it

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.860
for the women and children
of the Xiao family.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.859
When we have no power or influence,

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.860
we won't be trampled beneath others.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.300
Su Jinyuan.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.099
Isn't your goal simply
to help Xie Yunyan rise?

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:34.860
Is it?

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:35.900
Yes.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.220
Good.

00:10:39.512 --> 00:10:41.082
Do you dare make a wager with me?

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.139
Qi Sheng. Why must you
make things difficult for her?

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.300
What wager?

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.459
I won't stop you from stockpiling grain.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.060
I can even help.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.459
But once disaster strikes,

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.700
the grain must be delivered.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.082
I will see to it

00:11:01.175 --> 00:11:03.975
that Xie Yunyan is appointed
Imperial Envoy for disaster relief.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.940
Giving him a chance to soar.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.660
All right.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.940
I agree.

00:11:13.425 --> 00:11:15.505
But on one condition.

00:11:15.962 --> 00:11:17.402
You are certain

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.280
drought will come.

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:21.432
Sure.

00:11:21.637 --> 00:11:22.997
If not,

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.259
I, Su Jinyuan,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.220
will accept any punishment
from Your Lordship.

00:11:27.462 --> 00:11:28.582
Very well.

00:11:28.962 --> 00:11:30.245
It's a deal.

00:11:31.125 --> 00:11:32.582
A deal.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.740
Heir Qi.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.059
It's late.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.220
Night has fallen.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.660
Please take your leave.

00:11:46.112 --> 00:11:47.249
Otherwise, if others see

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.220
you visiting Xiao Manor too often,

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.700
be careful that the debauched persona
you worked so hard to uphold

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.900
just crumbles away.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.540
This heir...

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.700
He does care for the people somewhat.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.500
In the future, perhaps

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.100
he may accomplish great things.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.180
In your eyes,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.060
am I that incapable?

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.732
Would you have me sacrifice you

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.060
in exchange for my own success?

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.660
Of course not.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.449
I just don't want you to work so hard.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.450
But you shouldn't let Qi Sheng
pull the strings.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.361
How do you know what he wants?
What if he asks...

00:12:28.362 --> 00:12:30.320
At worst, I can serve as his slave or maid.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.499
I don't mind.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.820
But I do.
