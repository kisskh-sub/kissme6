[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.960
[Episode 39]

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.710
Cut the nonsense.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.039
Mr. Richard

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.920
needs to discuss

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.710
the specific details of the cooperation
with you.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.000
You need to send someone out

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.800
to sign on behalf of Liangjiang.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.700
I assure you

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.120
it'll be quick

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.050
and won't take up much of your time.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.630
You little brat.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.410
When you bite someone,
it goes straight to the bone, huh?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.130
Gu Pingyuan.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.310
Yes, Your Excellency.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.680
Since things cannot be undone now,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.510
I now grant you full authority

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.640
to act on behalf of
the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.300
in all external negotiations

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.240
as well as financial and grain matters.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.150
All the manpower and resources
of Liangjiang

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.350
are at your disposal,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.030
and all officials of Liangjiang

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.829
are ready to follow your orders.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.840
You handle it!

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.960
[Righteous and Diligent]

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.120
We need to confirm

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.680
your qualifications.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.520
We need to confirm

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.780
your qualifications.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.680
What qualifications?

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.000
What qualifications?

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.360
We've been accustomed to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.770
dealing with the Qing Dynasty's officials,

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.570
the ones with peacock feathers
behind their hats.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.960
I'd like to ask

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.240
if Xianghe Trade House

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.360
is a government institution
of your country?

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.740
If not,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.840
and if

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.750
what we are negotiating now

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.470
is purely a commercial matter,

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.080
then what right do they have

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.920
to demand that
our imperial court officials

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.100
attend?

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.240
Do you have the authority
to sign a contract

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.640
on behalf of Liangjiang?

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.790
Of course.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.050
I believe that before I arrived,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.360
the official documents
from the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.680
had already been delivered to you.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.430
Alright.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.030
Chinese people are not that trustworthy.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.079
He said Chinese people
are not trustworthy.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.360
But our country would never

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.440
go to war to protect opium.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.829
That's the difference
between our two countries.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.560
The title deeds for
all the salt fields and salt shops

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.360
are in order.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.190
What's next?

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.950
These title deeds for land are effective.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.960
And then?

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.510
He said he wants to acquire

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.750
all the shares of

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.830
our Lianghuai salt industry.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.430
Is there a problem with that?

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.390
The salt industry has always been
a state monopoly under the imperial court.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.580
In your country,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.370
do they allow merchants

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.630
to sell salt freely?

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.480
[Elements of International Law]

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.750
The Elements of International Law.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.070
I specifically had someone

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.470
translate your country's commercial law.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.010
According to your law,

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.270
for any industry that is

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.070
exclusively operated and sold
by the government,

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.800
the government naturally

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.690
holds a certain share.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.870
If he has any disagreement

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:51.920
on this point,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.950
we can resolve it

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.550
through official channels.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.390
Isn't that ironic?

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.620
He said

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.680
isn't that ironic,
talking about commercial laws

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.000
in our Qing Dynasty?

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.160
Then let's take this to their country.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.360
I believe if we pursue this lawsuit,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.090
spending 4 or 5 years on it

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.420
shouldn't be a problem.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.240
It's just I'm afraid that by that time,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.360
whether Mr. Richard

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.360
will still hold his current position

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.360
at Xianghe Trade House

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.490
is hard to say.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.120
By that time, if Li Qin's account

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.360
cannot be settled for too long

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.620
and becomes a bad debt,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.730
I'll feel concerned on his behalf.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.790
He said

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.360
our Xianghe Trade House believes

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.070
that we have the right to claim

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.730
ownership of our collateral.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.900
There's no dispute about that, right?

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.870
No.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.800
But I want to remind him

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.510
from a merchant's perspective

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:57.310
that all business transactions

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.030
should be based on freedom

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.240
and voluntary participation.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.070
If he enters

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.240
the Qing Dynasty's commercial market

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.600
with this attitude,

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.040
it would be a complete mistake.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.600
The title deeds

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.520
he currently holds for those salt fields—

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.650
I can guarantee

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.680
that once he sees them, he'll realize

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.600
they're nothing

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.460
but flat rocks.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.570
No one will be willing to work for him,

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.920
and the so-called deeds
to those salt shops

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.780
are nothing but empty buildings.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.010
No one will be willing to
run a store for him,

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.770
and he'll

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.510
gain absolutely nothing.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.950
Oh, I have many ways

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.040
to make my collateral profitable.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.120
He said

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.659
they have many ways

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.310
to make

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.040
their collateral profitable.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.040
They can sell it to other countries

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.560
or

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:43.820
sell it to our imperial court.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.270
In short,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.630
in this world,

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.120
we Chinese care too much about dignity.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.700
They don't believe we can

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.240
achieve our business goals

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.120
through patience and delay.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:59.750
If there's a cannon

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.150
pointing at my doorstep,

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.140
then whatever means I use

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.970
would be beyond reproach.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.510
If a cannon faces our home,

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.510
I cannot be blamed

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.750
for anything I do.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.030
Until the goal is achieved,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.360
the cannons shall not be withdrawn.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.460
Until the goal is achieved,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.480
the cannons shall not be withdrawn.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.159
But maybe

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.390
we can

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.360
continue our negotiations in one month.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.950
He said perhaps we can come again

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.510
to continue our negotiations in one month.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.640
Because he knows

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.620
the Emperor and Empress Dowager

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.690
have set you a deadline.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.720
Maybe in one month,

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.950
I shall be seeing

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.480
your head on the city wall.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.159
Maybe in one month...

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.240
He'll see

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.380
your head on the city wall.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.360
Li Qin,

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.720
how could you say such things?

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.430
He's right.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.170
Perhaps we should both take a step back.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.390
If Li Qin wants to mortgage

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.430
all the title deeds of
the salt fields and shops

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.510
that he currently holds,

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.040
I believe you're also aware

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.880
that in principle, he's not qualified.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.140
To gain complete control,

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.850
he has to wait a bit longer.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.530
We

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.210
made a bet before,

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:34.909
about which one would be more profitable,

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:37.070
the Lianghuai Salt Industry Guild

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.120
or his Li family.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.600
I remember that this bet

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.059
has less than a month left,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.350
and its outcome

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.490
will determine the ownership
of the salt industry.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.190
You're telling me

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.080
that you wanna compete

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.030
with an international trade company?

00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.760
Are you sure?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.600
Of course.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.050
I need to ensure

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.110
that the account audit
is accurate and valid,

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.510
that the competition is fair,

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.040
and that the results
are mutually confirmed.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.250
I need a contract.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.670
We need a contract.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.330
Anything else you want to say?

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.720
that once the child is born,

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.310
we'll have him recognize you
as Godmother.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.790
If it weren't for you

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:29.920
giving me those few hints,

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.480
who knows

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.960
how long I would have remained confused?

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.920
That's absolutely true.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.940
Of course it is.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.200
Otherwise, I wouldn't let you off.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.690
Come on, sit.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:38.960
But

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.370
how did you find out?

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.030
We sent someone to deliver some medicine.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.620
He doesn't know anything.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.830
Since your mother passed away,

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.960
you've been having a hard time, right?

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.040
Alright.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:51.000
Buddy,

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.160
let's get down to business.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.820
What big deal have you brought?

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:55.550
You have no idea

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.720
how exhausted I've been
these past 10 days.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.400
First,

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.880
I visited all the silk factories

00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.880
in the Huzhou and Jinling area.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.510
Then

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.350
I went to visit

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.030
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.360
After leaving here,

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.030
I still have to go to Hangzhou
to meet with Wu Caishen.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.550
He's been in the silk business for years,

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:10.160
so he must have plenty in stock.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.350
After that, I also need to
go to the capital

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.110
and pay a visit to
the Office of General Management.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.750
Why?

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.550
Recently,

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.790
I've been studying
the "Elements of International Law."

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.270
It states that

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.080
trade is free in all countries.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.010
Our country's exports

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:25.160
[Pine and Bamboo Contain Charm]

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.560
to India fall mainly into

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.750
4 categories:

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.880
tea, silk, medicine, and porcelain.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.400
I don't know much about porcelain,

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.350
but I have some connections
for the other three.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.200
I plan to follow my previous plan:

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.400
I want to bypass the East India Company.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.310
You want to transport

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.270
the goods directly to India?

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.640
If possible,

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.840
I want to go even further.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.680
All the way west across the Indian Ocean

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.440
to sell to the British

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.500
and Americans.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.830
Since they can come to our country,

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.760
why can't we go to their countries?

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.350
Come on, let's have a drink.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.810
That's a bit frightening.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.280
I'll drink too.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.150
I heard you have a 6-month bet

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.350
with Xianghe Trade House

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.310
over the salt field property rights.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.270
How could you still have time

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.330
to deal with all these other matters?

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.070
Madam, do you think I can win?

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:13.950
You can't?

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.110
Given the current situation,

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.440
I definitely can't win.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:18.880
If you want your business to grow,

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.960
the market has to be big.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.720
Our market

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.680
is limited to 13 provinces,
7 in the south and 6 in the north.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.880
Except for the 5 salt-producing regions,

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.830
in the remaining provinces,

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.700
the scale and profits of salt shops

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.160
are basically saturated.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:30.240
So where does Xianghe Trade House's profit

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.630
come from?

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.350
From hand to hand, basically.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.550
They sell directly to
the East India Company.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.480
They want to get capital into
the salt industry,

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.830
and they're willing to spend more money
to do so.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:40.920
As for who the East India Company

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.770
plans to sell to next—

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:42.830
only heaven knows.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.950
But with their market scale,

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.160
this amount of salt

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.640
is still manageable for them.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.270
Buddy.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.030
You're trying to take on

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.030
the East India Company by yourself—

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.170
do you think that's possible?

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:56.720
You're trying to use one man's power

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.120
against a whole country.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.780
Your ambition is admirable,

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.520
but it's simply impossible.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.920
You know that when I went abroad before,

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.490
I also sold to local agents.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.510
The profit was indeed a bit higher.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.480
But since we still rely on
the foreigners' ships,

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.510
opportunities to go abroad
still aren't frequent.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:12.480
If you want to establish

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.540
your own business foundation there,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.250
even 10 or 20 years wouldn't be enough.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.010
I don't have 10 or 20 years.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.160
It can't be done.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.090
It's just impossible.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.300
Human capability has its limits.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.670
Besides, in this era,

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.120
this kind of business

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.960
can no longer be considered
ordinary commerce—

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.690
it's more like a competition
between countries.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.170
You're being too unrealistic.

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.370
The raw silk,

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:38.970
tea,

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.200
and other goods you bring in—

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.920
how much capital do you need to tie up?

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.240
The Qing Dynasty explicitly prohibits

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.160
merchants from

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.350
doing business abroad freely,

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.750
right?

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:47.770
You'd be breaking the imperial law.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.030
And you even want to charter
British merchant ships.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:51.360
Would customs approve?

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.250
Would the merchant ships agree?

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:54.170
As far as I know,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.270
the merchant ships in Shanghai

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.670
are mostly owned by
the East India Company.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.170
And one last thing.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.680
Even if you overcome

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.790
all these difficulties

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.790
and get the goods transported to India,

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:05.590
let me ask you:

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:07.030
where will be your warehouse?

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.590
Where will be your headquarters?

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:09.590
Where will be your branch stores?

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.480
Who will be the manager
and who will be the staff?

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.140
You'll be completely in the dark.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.040
Who will you sell to, buddy?

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:19.080
Also, tea and silk

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.510
are both perishable.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:21.640
At most, you'd have

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.320
only 2 or 3 months to sell them.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.370
Tea ages, and silk deteriorates.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:26.480
One small mistake

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.210
and you could lose everything.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.240
Madam.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.070
You don't understand.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.830
Of course I understand.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:34.290
Well...

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.240
His plan is to send a warning shot,

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.480
forcing the East India Company

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.830
to return the salt field ownership

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.350
they took.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:42.160
But the question is,

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.440
can you really achieve that
by following the same method?

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.870
This place

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.440
doesn't look like a merchant's residence.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.270
Before my father became a businessman,

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:07.610
he used to be a scholar.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.200
So why didn't he become an official?

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.070
Don't all Chinese people

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:17.070
want to take the imperial exams
and become officials?

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.110
It was because he felt that

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.510
holding an official position was useless.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.810
Because the once-proud Qing Dynasty

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.380
had already come to an end.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.750
Young Master,

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:35.550
they're here.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.080
My respects, Your Excellency.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.350
Li Qin.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.830
I'm here on imperial order to
raid your house.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.030
Are you aware of that?

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:29.310
Please elaborate, Your Excellency.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.510
You mortgaged the salt field title deeds

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:35.160
to Xianghe Trade House,

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.880
severely damaging Liangjiang's economy.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.520
I went to the capital
to offer a humble apology,

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:42.950
but the Empress Dowager was furious.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.830
In my opinion,
although you and your father

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.960
both bought your official positions,

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.960
you're after all
subjects of the Qing Dynasty.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.640
If you repent now,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.330
we can still negotiate.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:54.590
Otherwise,

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.200
don't blame me for being ruthless.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:08.880
You've wanted to raid my house

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.480
for a long time, haven't you?

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:12.590
Ever since my father died,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.930
countless people have been eyeing

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.120
our Li family's fortune.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.790
According to
the "Great Qing Legal Code,"

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.960
I'm also going to have you arrested.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.510
Stand up.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:28.510
Mr. Li Qin

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:30.830
is now

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.110
a partner of Xianghe Trade House.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.350
You have no authority to arrest him.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.200
This

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.510
is the identity certificate

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.480
our envoy issued for him.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:01.510
Li Qin.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.010
Are you even abandoning
your ancestors now?

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.530
I have no ancestors.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.520
Nonsense!

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.640
Did you spring from a rock?

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.110
What do you mean you have no ancestors?

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.040
Utter nonsense!

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.160
Do you expect me to acknowledge

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.490
those people surnamed Gu as my ancestors?

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.400
I don't even know if my father's surname

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.960
was Li or Gu.

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.270
No one ever told me

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.600
where they were buried,

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:50.330
and I have no idea who they actually were.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.590
After my father died,

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.440
I suddenly realized that in this world,

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.070
I'm actually completely alone.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.790
So save your breath.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.350
Are you sure

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.300
you don't want to reconsider?

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:23.880
You've said everything you needed to say.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.510
Let's go.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.730
Confiscate everything!

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:41.590
What a fine and virtuous person
you once were—

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.310
how did you end up a traitor?

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.250
Such a wonderful home,

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.550
gone like that.

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.750
My home was long gone—

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:12.920
back when my father

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.550
lied to me.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.360
For the rest of my life...

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:20.400
For the rest of my life,

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.130
I want to be a different person.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:23.350
Li,

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.400
come and join the East India Company.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.960
In 6 months,

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.560
you'll be able to control

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.350
the Qing Dynasty's
most important industry.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.160
You can buy a even better house then.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.780
Can you really win?

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:40.720
That buddy of mine

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.700
is extremely cunning.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.240
It's useless to be cunning.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:53.000
In business, we don't rely on
cunning—

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.570
we rely on strength,

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.400
and on cannons.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.680
Could your buddy

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.720
be even more powerful than

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.050
the East India Company?

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:25.900
[Hangzhou]

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:27.920
Mr. Gu!

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.510
Here.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:36.750
I've been hearing so much about you lately

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:38.950
that my ears are nearly deaf from it all.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:39.790
Well, we businessmen

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:41.200
pray to the God of Wealth every day.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.270
If that caused deafness,
I'd be deaf long ago.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.130
Come on, let me show you the goods.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.900
Please come in, Mr. Gu.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.000
Open it.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.030
Let's take a look at the goods first.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.410
This is simply...

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.240
What do you think?

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:15.790
I've always considered myself

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:17.920
someone who has seen fine embroidery.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.510
But after seeing your goods, I realized

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.510
everything I'd seen before

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:22.510
was just garbage.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:26.520
The embroidery from Huizhou

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.320
is certainly quite good.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.200
However,

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:31.640
compared to the embroidery
from Hangzhou and Suzhou,

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.440
it definitely

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.440
can't match up.

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:37.740
Also, check out our embroiderers.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.360
They've all served in the imperial palace.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.030
Since childhood,

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.080
apart from using chopsticks,

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.880
they've never done any other manual work

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.880
with their hands.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:47.960
Why is that?

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:53.110
You see, these hands of ours,

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.930
if they do even a bit of rough work,

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.570
they lose their smoothness and softness.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:00.690
Our embroiderers here

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.310
have learned embroidery since childhood

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.270
and have been waited on hand and foot.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.470
To be honest with you,

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:08.840
they use the finest wax
to take care of their hands every day.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:13.250
Only this way can they work on silk

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.960
with thousands upon thousands of stitches

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.470
without leaving any trace

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.470
or causing

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:21.350
any pilling on the silk surface.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:22.270
These are all

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:23.800
big secrets of our silk industry.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.550
I'm only telling you this

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.750
because you aren't in this line of work.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:28.630
God of Wealth,

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:29.880
you've truly mastered

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.010
the art of business.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:31.840
Unlike me,

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.880
biting off more than I can chew.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.280
Come on, sit.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.440
You may leave now.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:46.310
I heard

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.770
something big happened in Jiangning,

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.360
that you've gotten into a conflict
with Xianghe Trade House?

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.920
I heard that you, God of Wealth,

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.120
have business dealings
with Xianghe Trade House, right?

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:02.530
In the silk business,

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:03.720
Xianghe Trade House

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:04.880
is indeed my

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.200
biggest competitor.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.210
That Richard is a cunning old fox.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:11.110
You may not be able to outwit him.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:14.310
Even if I can't, I still have to fight.

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:15.640
Those foreigners are trying

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.200
to monopolize the entire salt industry
of Lianghuai.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.000
God of Wealth,

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:20.410
no matter what,

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:22.080
you must lend me a hand.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.680
Our two families
have been competing for decades.

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:31.020
Tell me,

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.920
what good strategy do you have in mind?

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.160
If it's truly workable,

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.690
I'd certainly be happy to
enjoy the benefits.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.710
I want to know

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.400
if the Xianghe Trade House

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.830
is the East India Company's

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:42.510
only institution

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.240
stationed in our Qing Dynasty?

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.110
Of course not.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.240
So is the East India Company

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.200
the only

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.570
British commercial company in India?

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.480
No, this East India Company

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.720
is just one of them.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:56.590
But in terms of scale,

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:58.470
it is indeed the largest.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.030
I don't need the scale to be very large.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.290
Actually, this method

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:07.790
is something I learned from
the "Strategies of the Warring States."

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:09.080
It can help you, Mr. Wu,

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.760
sweep away your competitor.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:13.880
What do you mean by that?

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.290
I need the finest goods

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:17.610
you have in your stock.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.920
That's easy.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.700
Just tell me what you want

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:22.000
and where you want it shipped.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.060
I'll hire a ship to deliver it for you.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.240
We can't use ordinary ships.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.240
I want to contact a British company

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.750
and use the foreigners' ships

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:30.790
to transport the goods to India,

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.390
or even directly to Britain.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.550
I also need you

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.010
to come with me to Shanghai

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.920
to meet Mr. Hart from the Customs Office.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:39.790
I plan to set sail westward

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:42.590
and use
the "Besiege Wei to rescue Zhao" strategy.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.160
I'm afraid I won't be able to
rent such ships.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.590
Someone else will help me rent them.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:48.960
I know

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.480
you're on good terms with Mr. Hart,

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.240
so I must

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.510
take you with me.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:58.590
Buddy.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Do you really mean

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.030
your words?

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.380
I've made a solemn pledge.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.800
This is no joking matter.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.510
[Hart's Residence, Shanghai]

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.190
I expected you'd come,

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:13.920
but I didn't expect it to be this late.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.520
Is that so?

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.110
I wasn't referring to you.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.639
I didn't expect you to come.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.969
But it was only right

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.840
that he came.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.800
I'm taking the blame for someone else.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.659
I had to come.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.420
This mess has gotten serious.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:27.840
I've received an imperial edict
these past days.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.150
The Empress Dowager

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.550
has strictly ordered
the Viceroy of Liangjiang

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:32.110
to reclaim the salt fields.

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:33.550
What on earth is going on with you guys?

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.810
You've provoked the East India Company?

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:38.889
I'll put in a good word for you.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:40.610
Business like this

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:41.550
can't be done

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:43.010
through personal favors.

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.949
If I were the East India Company,

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.210
it wouldn't matter who came begging.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.400
Did you receive the information,

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.480
or did you figure this out on your own?

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.440
Sir, you've already
gone to negotiate with them, haven't you?

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.710
As soon as I received the edict,

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:57.630
I went to negotiate,

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.690
but it didn't work.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:00.510
Apart from opium,

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:02.350
it seems that the Chinese market

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:05.110
isn't welcoming to British goods.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:09.070
Your Excellency.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.150
Greetings, Your Excellency.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.750
Come sit here and let's talk.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.680
Let me ask you:

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.590
how many salt shops

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:23.760
does your

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.510
Salt Industry Guild currently control?

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:27.480
In response to your question,
Your Excellency,

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.630
including the newly opened

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:30.040
117 shops,

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:32.550
there's a total of 305.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.650
With these 305 shops,

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:35.670
not counting

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:38.360
the money you've invested in
newly opened shops,

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.360
at your most profitable time,

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.490
could you make 10 million taels a year?

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:46.990
Not that much, I suppose.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.600
By my estimate, it's only about

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:50.640
9 million taels,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.460
with little fluctuation.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.230
The point is this is just gross profit.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.550
It's...

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:55.880
That's not right.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.030
What's not right?

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.690
Your boss Mr. Gu

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.150
has been making big moves recently.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:03.680
Didn't you know about that?

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.490
Are you referring to

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.590
Mr. Gu going to Anhui to collect tea?

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.680
It's far more than just tea collection.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.360
Silk, medicine—

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.960
he's dealing in everything now.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.960
Besides,

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.190
he's now openly saying

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.720
he's going to ship a batch of goods
to Britain.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.320
I want to contact a British company

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.440
that competes with

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.000
the East India Company

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:30.280
and partner with them

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.760
in tea, silk, medicine

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.880
and other businesses.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.230
I'll have this British company

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:35.190
handle my sales,

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.760
and I'll be the supplier
allocating the goods.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.620
I can guarantee

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.420
that all goods from my side

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.150
are of the highest quality,

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.150
and I can guarantee to
procure it at the lowest price.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.800
If we can

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.840
carve out a market of our own

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.360
within every commercial sector

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.090
the East India Company covers,

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.110
we can force them

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:51.440
to come and negotiate with us.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.400
With a monster like this—

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.530
a commercial giant—

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:54.760
gentle persuasion is useless.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.000
You have to make them scared,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.360
make them feel threatened.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.090
I've made a rough calculation.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.320
The cost of this shipment of goods

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.250
is equivalent to

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.400
what your Salt Industry Guild

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.480
makes in 3 years.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.320
Where is he getting that money from?

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.520
You're producing salt,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.550
not mining gold.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Your Excellency.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.440
I've also

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:18.170
caught some rumors out there.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:19.320
Some friends of his

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:20.940
gave him the goods

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:22.850
but didn't collect the money—

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.190
said they'd settle it
after the goods are sold...

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.920
If this batch of goods
were to be transported

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.480
from Shanxi to Shandong,

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.290
I could understand delaying the payment.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:33.320
With Mr. Gu reputation,

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.800
it wouldn't be a problem.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.300
But this is going overseas
across the ocean.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:40.710
This is a completely different matter.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.440
I have something to instruct you on.

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:48.150
Your Excellency,

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:49.230
please give your instructions.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:51.160
I did ask him to compete with Li Qin,

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:52.840
but I never expected

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:54.320
he would go this far.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.590
Our Qing Dynasty has its
official factories

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.280
and the Office of General Management.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.590
Who does he think he is,

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:00.970
selling goods abroad?

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:04.200
If we let him set this precedent,

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:05.840
will the laws of the Qing Dynasty

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.320
have to be rewritten?

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:11.710
You're all experienced and mature.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:13.830
Don't follow his reckless path.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.480
Keep the Salt Industry Guild

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.610
in good order for me.

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:19.750
Do you know

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:20.920
why the East India Company

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.030
has become

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.800
so powerful?

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:24.030
Look down there.

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:25.550
All the merchant ships on this river

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:26.410
belong to them.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:28.590
May I ask how you plan

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.190
to transport your goods to India,

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.360
or even to Britain?

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.460
I'll use warships.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:35.230
British warships?

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.760
I have my way.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.400
My transportation costs

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.200
will be lower than all of theirs.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:42.800
Then let me ask you another question.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.800
The East India Company
has been doing business

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.190
with the Qing Dynasty for years.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.360
I believe the goods they acquire

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.630
come at

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.510
extremely low prices.

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:53.510
So what advantage do you have
against them?

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.020
I have contact with

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.670
all the tea merchants in Anhui,

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:58.480
the finest silk

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.510
and raw silk in the Liangjiang region,

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:02.230
and medicinal herbs from Shanxi,

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:04.360
things like rhubarb and goji berries.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.710
I can procure all of these goods

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.110
at the lowest prices,

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.730
ensuring ample profit.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.110
The lowest prices?

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:14.800
Can you really guarantee that?

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.120
Merchants do seek profit, that's true.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.150
But this time,

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:20.880
I don't want any profit,

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.440
nor do my friends.

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:24.280
Though our Qing Dynasty is weak,

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.400
we must never let others

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.730
control our lifelines.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.480
It simply means that this year,

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.590
our silk business in Jiangnan

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.800
will operate without profit.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.110
I can guarantee this.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.100
What about the others?

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.630
Do the tea and medicine merchants

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:45.960
also think the same way?

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.110
Mr. Hart.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.920
Don't underestimate us

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.670
unarmed merchants.

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.700
In the way of commerce,

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.510
petty schemes serve oneself,

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:57.420
but great strategies serve the nation.

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.880
Even in business battles,

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.040
one can still serve their country.

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:06.760
What does this mean?

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.370
Are these merchants really going to

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:09.110
join forces

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:10.740
t-to defeat that guy?

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:14.070
Whether they'll defeat him or not

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:15.200
is still uncertain.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.090
But at the very least,
we must let them know

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:19.570
that we Chinese merchants

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.230
can make money

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.540
even without using gunboats.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.070
Thank goodness we got out.

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:53.670
It felt like hell

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:54.840
in there.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.480
Those foreigners

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.000
aren't used to our opera.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.440
All that clang clang clang—

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.370
they think the gongs are too noisy.

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:07.350
Let me ask you.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.280
Are you doing this out of spite,

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.370
or are you serious?

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:13.880
What do you mean by that?

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.920
If you're just doing this out of spite,

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.360
we can work together

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.320
to scare this East India Company

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.120
into retreating, and that's it.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.630
People travel far for profit.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.840
No one truly wants to make enemies.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.250
But if you're serious,

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.160
then it's dangerous.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.360
This is something that's never happened

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.590
in 3,000 years.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:40.150
What if I tell you

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.480
that I am serious?

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.110
Stop joking.

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:51.320
You're not actually
planning to do this, are you?

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:53.230
This is the Qing Dynasty,

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:54.190
not England.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.320
If you really get a ship

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.360
and transport the goods overseas,

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.710
where does that leave the imperial court?

00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:58.480
The "Great Qing Legal Code"

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.940
has no provision for this.

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:02.710
Mr. Wu.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:06.000
I have something I want to say,

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.530
but I'm not sure if I should.

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.590
Go on.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.590
I'm all ears.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.840
I think the problem is that our country

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.500
has had emperors for too long.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.540
Don't talk nonsense.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:19.040
This kind of talk

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.160
could cost you your head.

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:23.390
Look at the ships on the river.

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:26.070
These foreigners

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:28.230
brought cannons and gunpowder here

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:30.650
to protect their country's business

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:33.190
and mobilized their entire national army

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:34.790
to protect their merchants,

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:37.190
determined to sell their goods

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:38.400
to our country

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.150
and seize our domestic market.

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:41.920
I believe that
when these merchants come in,

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.380
the influence behind them

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:44.710
far surpasses

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:45.840
the power of an army.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:49.290
In the way of commerce,

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.480
great strategies serve the nation.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.060
We have to find a way
to compete with them.

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:55.400
It would be best to go to their countries

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.480
and do business there.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.740
Let people make full use of
their abilities,

00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.590
and let goods flow to
where they're needed.

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:01.050
Perhaps only by doing this

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:02.320
can we find

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.110
a way out.
