Where is Mr. Qingya
that you were told to find?

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.079
He is nowhere to be found.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.799
We cannot reach him anymore.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.200
He claimed to support
our military expense reforms,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.560
yet he waited for his chance
to strike from behind,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.599
hoping to provoke turmoil
within the army.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.599
What a cunning Mr. Qingya.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.200
Could it be

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.460
that he belongs to those pedants
from the Ministry of Revenue?

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.290
Behind the Ministry of Revenue,

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.439
he seems to be in league with Li Yuanze.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.159
The reform of military funds

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.920
(Register of Noble Clans)
is meant to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.600
shake the foundations of noble families.

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.680
But because the expenses are too large,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.599
every department
is fighting for their share.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.800
They all complain it is too little,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.919
and conflict broke out.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.520
No.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.919
It is not collusion.

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:30.879
In my view,

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.919
they might be the same person.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.319
There is one more matter.

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:39.840
A scout reported back.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.199
They say Liu Zhen's family
is still alive.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.719
The Princess Royal

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.319
has even sent them
to Li Yuanze's Residence.

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:47.280
What?

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.990
The late emperor's mourning period
is not yet over,

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.120
Your Highness,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.719
and you are already eager to marry.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120
Xiao Pingning.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.240
Li Yuanze.

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.120
How dare you both make a fool of me.

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:14.680
Since this is your choice,

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.120
you shall not blame me.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.439
Your Majesty,
I have a memorial to present.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.439
General Gan Sheng
has forged weapons in secret.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.159
Many matters...

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.919
Report!

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.039
Your Majesty, urgent news!

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.919
From the front line.

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.039
Nanjiang is in turmoil.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.080
What happened?

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.159
A few days ago, a squad of light cavalry
claimed to act under Jing's banner

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.580
and infiltrated Nanjiang's royal lands.

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.439
They killed the envoys
who delivered tribute.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.970
The King of Nanjiang flew into rage

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.490
and immediately
sent troops across the border.

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:48.919
Pass down my order.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.039
Find out at once

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.840
who orchestrated this.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.840
Yes.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.879
Your Majesty,
there is no need to investigate.

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.879
It was Gan Sheng.

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:03.919
I was careless.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.439
It seems his true aim

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.120
has always been Nanjiang.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.260
(Learned and Resolute)

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.879
Nanjiang is already in chaos now.

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.680
Word has reached the court.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.319
The ministers
are gathered discussing this matter.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.360
Gan Sheng...

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:24.920
I have underestimated him.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.319
Come. We enter the palace.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:30.319
Yes, Your Highness.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:35.240
What are you doing?

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.560
Don't move.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.240
Let me go.

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:38.879
Let go of me!

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.160
Release me.

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.959
Let me go!

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.560
Your Highness seems in quite the hurry.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.279
Where are you planning to go?

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.759
Your Highness.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.000
You still have not answered my question.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.000
Where are you going?

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:07.160
Your Highness.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.439
Let me go!

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.199
Your Highness!

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.399
Your Majesty,
the war in Nanjiang grows urgent.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.410
Looking across the court,

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:34.160
only General Gan
has the ability to lead troops,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.519
and quell the unrest.

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:37.439
I humbly request Your Majesty

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.360
to grant General Gan
the title of Prince Wu'an,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.199
so as to reassure
the hearts of all army.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.240
- We implore Your Majesty
- We implore Your Majesty

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.199
- confer General Gan as Prince Wu'an
- confer General Gan as Prince Wu'an

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:52.079
- to calm the hearts of our troops.
- to calm the hearts of our troops.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.800
Very well.

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:05.279
General Gan, I shall confer upon you
the title of Prince Wu'an,

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.279
and order you to pacify the borders.

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:12.879
- Your Majesty, please reconsider.
- Your Majesty, please reconsider.

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:16.839
Thanks, Your Majesty.

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.199
Your Majesty,

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.399
I humbly have one more request.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.720
I wish to marry the Princess Royal.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.000
I beg Your Majesty to grant this.

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:45.560
You...

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.319
Insolence!

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.399
You...

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:48.839
Absurdity!

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.759
The late emperor's mourning
is not yet over.

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.920
How can the Princess Royal marry now?

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:57.639
Is that so?

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.160
Official Lin seems to know little of me.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.519
I

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.759
have never cared for rules
made for the dead.

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:21.079
You...

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:22.240
You…

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.780
- Official Lin.
- Official Lin.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.800
The Princess Royal and I
are bound by mutual affection.

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:32.480
I ask Your Majesty to fulfill this wish.

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:42.360
Your Highness,

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:44.240
what say you?

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:57.319
Your Highness.

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:00.639
Your Highness.

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:06.079
Why does Your Highness fear me so?

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:08.360
How could I ever harm you?

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.519
On the contrary,

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.240
I have a grand gift prepared for you.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.800
Care to guess what it is?

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.439
A kingdom.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.920
Nanjiang is in chaos,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.490
their armies press to our borders.

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:31.800
Under heaven,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.399
only I, Gan Sheng,

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:36.639
can resolve this crisis.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.240
But if I refuse to intervene,

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.879
not only His Majesty's life,

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.559
even the empire of Jing itself

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:49.200
may no longer be safe.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.240
Gan Sheng,

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:52.639
what is it you want?

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.519
I want to marry you.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.080
Xiao Pingning,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.960
have you never intended
to honor the betrothal?

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.039
I never once agreed to it.

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:13.559
If that is your answer,

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:16.879
then tomorrow in court, I shall request
an edict for our marriage.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.559
If you obey me,

00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:19.919
I will make you

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:21.960
the most honored woman in Jing.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.639
How about it?

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.519
I will offer one last piece
of advice, Your Highness.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.159
You know well

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.840
what happens if you anger me.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.480
Official Li.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.559
Wearing this mask for so long,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.000
can you still remove it?

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.879
Or perhaps

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.919
I should call you by another name.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.360
Mr. Qingya.

00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:07.000
General Gan has only just realized?

00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:09.320
You are rather slow, I must say.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.879
I could kill you right now.

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:12.679
Then you would not
have spoken like this.

00:10:13.559 --> 00:10:14.639
You dare not kill me.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.799
Not because you fear me,

00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:18.039
but because you fear
this brush in my hand.

00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:19.080
No.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.039
To be more precise,

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:23.759
you fear the brush of every scholar.

00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:26.440
You even justify rebellion
under the name of Nanjiang.

00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:30.759
A man like you cares deeply about
how history will record your name.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.039
The eyes of all ministers are upon you.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.600
You know well

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.000
once you kill me,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.039
you become a traitor.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.240
Condemned for generations.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.799
You want me dead,

00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:44.000
yet you dare not
let me die at your hand.

00:10:44.559 --> 00:10:45.879
Am I right?

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:51.279
Truly worthy of the name Mr. Qingya,

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.159
you know me far too well.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.600
Yet you are only half right.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.240
In this world,

00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:01.039
there are many fates
more painful than death.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.159
I will make you live to witness

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.360
how Jing falls into new hands.

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:09.519
And see

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.480
the woman you cherish

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.879
become my wife.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.879
When that day comes,

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.559
you may even beg me to end you.

00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:20.279
Grand Secretary.
