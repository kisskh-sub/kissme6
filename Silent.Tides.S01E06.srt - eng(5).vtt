You mean

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.870
there's an organization

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.850
helping them.

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.420
It must be either from Chongqing
or Yan'an.

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.770
Either side would be difficult

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.840
to deal with.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.729
Fortunately,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.289
the Japanese Imperial Army

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.260
has surrounded Macau.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.340
These people

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.730
won't be able to escape.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.310
The Special Operations Team
will expand the search area

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.150
and go all out.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.300
In addition,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.560
we've also deployed professional personnel

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.280
to monitor all phone lines

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.410

around the clock.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.360
But the British

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.180
have cut all the phone lines.

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.060
This is

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.970
to prevent escaped prisoners of war
who have fled to Macau

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.360

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.430
You're right.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.870
that effective immediately,

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.930
the Zhongshan Rice Market is closed.

On what grounds?

shutting it down?

I'll answer your question.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.800
Is there anyone who didn't hear clearly?

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.840
Since we announced the acceptance
of refugees,

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.420
the Japanese military, under the pretext
of evacuating Hong Kong refugees,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.690
has continuously sent ships
to transport people to Macau,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.930
yet not a single person has been allowed
to board a ship to leave.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.120
Simultaneously, they have imposed controls

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.980
on the Gongbei Port,
permitting entry but not exit.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.500
In just half a month,

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.090
Macau's population
has exceeded 450 thousand,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.250
three times what it was before the war.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.750
What about the food situation?

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.270
Macau's original rice reserves
were less than 5 thousand bags,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.310
which are now almost depleted.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.510
Coupled with the Japanese blockade
of the Gongbei Port,

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.250
not a single grain of food from Zhongshan
can be transported into Macau.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.510
As of yesterday,

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.250
the price of rice in Macau

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.360
has risen from 40 cents to one dollar,

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.040
an increase of 150 percent.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.190
If we don't find a way to control this,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.790

Can't you lower the price a little?

It's so cold today.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.800
Why aren't you wearing a coat?

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.830
Let me get it for you.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.220
No need. Go check if

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.480
the porridge is ready.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.720
Porridge?

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.360
Where did you get rice?

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.360
It won't be cold in Macau for much longer,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.960
so I traded clothes for rice.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.130
I'm not cold anyway.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.870
It's okay.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.940

it's my suit.

No. You're the one
who needs to be out there.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.010

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.300
how will you make a good impression?

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.130

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.500

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.510
How can you find work without a suit?

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.800
Oh.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:44.980
It's all right.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.960
Don't worry, I'm not cold.

No one will go hungry.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.800
Your Excellency the Governor,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.130
this is a huge misunderstanding.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.790
According to our naval report,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.330
it was those damn pirates

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.130
who robbed the Macau grain ship—

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.240
not

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.270
the Japanese Navy.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.330
Nonsense!

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:39.480
When the grain ship was robbed,

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:41.190
its radio transmission

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.560
never mentioned any pirates—

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.430
it only reported being intercepted
by the Japanese Navy.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.240
When our rescue team arrived afterward,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.860
they only saw

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.980
Japanese warships
filling the incident waters!

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.570
With such irrefutable evidence,

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.659
are you still trying
to quibble your way out of it?

00:07:55.659 --> 00:07:56.740
Here's the thing.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.120
The Japanese Navy

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.770
spotted pirates

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.130
and was in the process of pursuing them.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.620
It's hardly surprising that

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.330
the grain ship's crew saw our warships.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.500
As for what happened after,

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.800
the pirates made off with your grain cargo
and fled.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.000
We failed to catch up,

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:12.800
which is why

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.570
only our warships were left in the area.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.420
That's complete nonsense!

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.100
Nothing you've said is true!

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.240
If you don't believe me,

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.160
there's nothing I can do.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.680

What are you doing?

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:40.700
I'm sorry.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.700
I want to make some porridge,

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.160
but I don't really know
how to use this stove.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.360
Miss Qiao, you...

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.890
Your hands are for playing the violin.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.600
How can you do such rough work?

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.270
What if you burn yourself?

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.360
Food outside is too expensive.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.260
I thought I could cook for myself

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.600
to save some money.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.360
Why put yourself through this?

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.100
If you need anything,

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:09.630
I can...

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.270
I don't need anything.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.770
Thank you, Dr. Lok Pak.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.720
I can't take your money.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.360
And those other things,

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.620
please take them back.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.630
Don't bring them again next time,

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.390
or I won't open the door for you.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:23.320
Alright.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:23.860
Okay.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.340
Let me help you.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:33.820
Thank you.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.320
Also,

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.540
I should remind you of something else.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.550
From now on,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.110
Macau should temporarily
suspend all maritime trade.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.580
For the Imperial Navy,

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.450
to leave pirate gangs with nowhere
to hide,

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.150
will seize all suspicious vessels

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.890
until the pirates are
completely eradicated.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.260
What you're doing
will completely strangle Macau!

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.800
Don't put it that way.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.770
What do you mean by “strangling Macau”?

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.290
Eliminating pirates

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.640
is also a great deed for Macau
that will benefit generations to come.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.050
Sir,

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.310
why not take a longer-term view?

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:22.860
Fine,

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.100
I have another question.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.650
You say pirates are active
in the Lingding Channel,

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.600
but surely there can't be any
in Zhongshan.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.480
Zhongshan?

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:35.340
Haven't you heard anything about that?

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.740
No, I haven't.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.370
No, I really haven't heard of any there.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:39.940
Then,

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.580
since there are no pirates in Zhongshan,

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.840
why have you closed the Gongbei Port

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.410
and prohibited grain from Zhongshan
from entering Macau?

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.700
I can explain this matter

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.310
to you, sir.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.370
The suspension of grain trade
in Zhongshan County is

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.720
purely a measure taken
by the Wang Jingwei government in Nanjing

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.780
to crack down on smuggling,

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.540
and
it has absolutely no connection with us.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.170
Macau now

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.550
has nearly 400 thousand residents,

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.440
or even more than that!

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.410
By sealing Macau off completely like this,

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.750
how many people
are you going to drive to their deaths?

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.650
How can you

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.440
disregard so many lives

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.170
and just watch them die like this?

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:17.900
Your Excellency the Governor,

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.270
the Empire of Japan deeply sympathizes

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.500
with the difficulties
Macau is currently facing.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.270
Likewise,

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.860
the Empire has always hoped

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.940
to maintain friendly neighborly relations
with Macau.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.470
Right before your arrival,

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.250
we had just drafted

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.360
a cooperation plan

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.290
that was originally to be submitted
to the Government House.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:40.890
Since you've come in person,

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.660
you might as well take a look at it now.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.140
It's my fault for being useless.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.440
I only found out

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.200
the management staff of HSBC

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.130
are being detained
in a prisoner-of-war camp,

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.790
but I have no idea
about other specific details.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.510
However,

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.190
you don't need to worry too much.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.460
After all, Mr. Qiao is

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.010
an accountant,

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.200
and the Japanese

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.660
should not give him too much trouble.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:31.390
Okay.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.900
In the current situation,

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.290
getting news about them is
extremely difficult.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.790
Thank you for your efforts.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:41.590
It's nothing.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.380
Also,

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.340
as I mentioned last time,

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.910
my Bachongtian Club

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.170
really needs a violinist.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.630
If you would honor us with your talent,

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.760
the compensation would be excellent.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:12:59.790
I know

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.370
you don't want to accept my help.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.100
I understand and respect that.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:03.870
But

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.870
earning a living with your violin

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.120
would still be supporting yourself,
wouldn't it?

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.250
Thank you for your invitation.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.910
I understand your kindness.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.150
I will

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.680
seriously consider your suggestion.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:23.480
Okay.

all rice and grain merchants in Macau

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.530
are prohibited from hoarding
for speculation.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:44.000
Seventy percent
of each merchant's grain stock

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.790
must be surrendered
to the General Chamber of Commerce

confiscate our goods?

Even for relief efforts,

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.870

to pull together through this crisis.

in the grain business.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.040
Let me make my stance clear.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.460
First,

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.080
every last grain of Hengfengyu's inventory

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.250
will be donated in full
to disaster relief,

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.140
with none retained.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.740
Second,

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.410
all grain turned over
by the rice merchants here

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.420
will be treated as a loan to Hengfengyu.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.060
I, Ma Wanqi, will personally

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.820
take responsibility for issuing
promissory notes and formal contracts.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.500
Once this famine is over,

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.400
Hengfengyu will be obligated

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.910
to repay all the grain in full.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:21.950

about Mr. He.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.410
Mr. He doesn't own a house in Macau.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.100
If he's not staying at hotels or inns,

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.100
where could he be?

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.720
Perhaps Mr. He
and his family have rented a place.

well-conditioned properties

Hundreds of thousands of people
have suddenly flooded into Macau.

There must be countless people
renting places.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.030
while
the General Chamber of Commerce holds 60%.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:21.530
Moreover,

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:22.750
it has always been managed by Chairman Gao

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.510
and other Chinese merchants.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:25.550
Lyun Coeng

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:26.610
is also responsible for Macau's

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.550
goods procurement in mainland China.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.740
Rashly altering the controlling stake

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.200
would definitely impact

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.290
Macau's supply of daily necessities.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.220
Under the Imperial Army's blockade,

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.720
what daily necessities
could those Chinese merchants

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.320
from the General Chamber of Commerce
possibly provide to Macau?

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.620
Why don't you take a stake, Mr. Saito,

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.640
and co-manage the business
with Chinese merchants?

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.100
Would that be acceptable?

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.810
Given Japan's capabilities,

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.790
is that really necessary?

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.700
Either the Chinese merchants
from the General Chamber of Commerce

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.730
withdraw entirely from the board

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.570
and Lyun Coeng comes
under Japanese control,

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:08.700
and in the meantime,

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.280
Mr. Saito will take on the role
of chairman.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.720
Otherwise,

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.400
there's no point
in continuing this discussion.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.400
But the General Chamber of Commerce

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.610
holds 60% of the shares after all.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.400
Kicking them out for no reason

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.180
isn't appropriate.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.000
What about the 60% stake?

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.240
Lyun Coeng is a subsidiary
of the Macau government.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.440
The government has the authority

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.740
to decide the composition
of Lyun Coeng's board.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.740
Isn't that right?

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.940
If the government really transfers
the controlling stake of Lyun Coeng

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.790
to Mr. Saito,

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.800
Consul Fukue,

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.850
can you guarantee
that the Japanese military

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:50.750
will lift the blockade on Macau?

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.460
I think all I can guarantee is

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.750
to convey Macau's sincerity
to Agency Chief Sawa

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.350
and our headquarters.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.720
As long as we gain control of Lyun Coeng,

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.810
we will be responsible
for the daily necessities

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.750
of all officials and their families.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.750
I will ensure a steady supply
of all these goods,

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.210
including those for your Bachongtian Club.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.250
During the Imperial Army's blockade,

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:18.000
with so many guests
still expecting exotic delicacies

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.060
and lavish dishes,

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.130
Mr. Lok Pak, you must be struggling

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.940
despite the high profits, aren't you?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.740
Cheers.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:30.750
Cheers.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.830
Chairman,

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.330
the two interview candidates today

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.770
were carefully selected

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:37.850
from all the applicants.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.140
Here are their preliminary test papers
and resumes

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.070
for your review.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.070
Mr. Lok Pak,

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.090
why are you here?

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.240
Chairman Gao,

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.240
I'm not the only one here today.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.310
All government-affiliated directors
are present,

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.010
along with the newly appointed
board members

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.310
of Lyun Coeng,
as designated by the government.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:01.080
I'm sorry.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:01.880
[Empresa Comercial Lyun Coeng]

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.010
The company
called an emergency board meeting.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:05.460
The interview has been postponed.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.700
Please wait here for a while.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.420
Okay.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.070
Aren't you...

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:12.960
Xian,

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.890
I'm He Hongshen.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:14.830
Oh, right,

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:15.700
He Hongshen,

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.250
the student from HKU.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:18.530
So

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.660
we're the only two
who passed the preliminary interview.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.440
What a coincidence.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:28.200
What's that?

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.270
Don't laugh at me, Xian.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.550
Since I came to Macau,

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.950
I've been staying with distant relatives.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.850
I've had enough
of living under someone else's roof.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.140
I moved out a few days ago

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.770
and have been sleeping
on the streets for two nights.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.700
That's why I had to bring my bedroll
to the interview.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:45.770
So

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.290
you've had it rough too.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.110
Xian,

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.700
today is a fair competition.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.830
You can't go easy on me because of this.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.500
I asked around when I got here.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.680
Several employees at Lyun Coeng mentioned

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.830
that the other candidate
has more experience than me,

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.010
deeper qualifications,
and exceptional abilities.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.770
They say he's the top choice
for today's interview,

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.070
and I'm just a backup.

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:07.310
Fine,

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.380
let's compete fairly then.

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.340
But to be honest,

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.000
as someone
who only finished primary school,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.250
I'll probably

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.380
lose to a proper HKU graduate like you.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.990
Any change in shareholding

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.620
requires unanimous approval
from the board.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:23.750
The Japanese Chamber of Commerce
suddenly buying in

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:27.160
and demanding controlling interest
in Lyun Coeng right away—

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.020
what is the government thinking?

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.400
Well,

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.810
Chairman Gao,

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.850
you understand
the government's predicament.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:34.850
You know

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.700
the government had no choice.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.290
For the survival of all of Macau,

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:41.550
after careful consideration,

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.300
we had to make this decision.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:45.090
Besides,

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.110
the Japanese investment in Lyun Coeng

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.710
will strengthen the company, won't it?

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.360
It's business.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:53.420
Everyone cooperates

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.680
and manages together.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.240
So you're saying

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.320
the Japanese joining the board

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.380
is already a done deal.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.250
The shareholding ratio

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:06.650
can still be negotiated.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.290
But Mr. Saito becoming the chairman

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.230
has already been approved
by the government.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.610
In that case...

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.020
there's nothing to discuss.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.900
All the Chinese directors
of the General Chamber of Commerce

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.960
are withdrawing from Lyun Coeng now!

By the way,
where is your ancestral hometown, Xian?

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:38.070
Huh?

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.200
You don't think
I look like someone from there, right?

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.440
To be honest,

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.420
my great-grandfather was a Dutch Jew,

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.820
so I'm of mixed heritage.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:47.750
But

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.010
my family has considered ourselves Chinese
for generations,

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.610
using my great-grandmother's Bao'an lineage
as the ancestral origin.

Lyun Coeng's board of directors
was restructured,

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.350
and we, the Japanese side,
have taken over completely.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:57.380
But rest assured.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.070
All the recruitment conditions
previously promised by the company,

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.010
including the position and benefits,

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:04.750
will remain unchanged.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.000
Any other questions?

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.220
No.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.270
Then let's begin the interview.

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.220
I remember Lyun Coeng

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.250
has always been engaged
in trade of daily necessities

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.050
between Macau and the mainland.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.240
Why the sudden interest

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.370
in procuring these special supplies?

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.180
This is
our company's new development objective.

Mr. He,

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.330
you had done business
in Guangdong and Hong Kong

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:48.620
for so many years.

and tung oil

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.500
would surely be effortless for you.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.700
Let me put it this way.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.880
You only need to accomplish one thing—

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.500
find the supply sources the company needs

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:05.070
and handle their long-term procurement
for the company.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.130
No matter how much,

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:07.880
Lyun Coeng will buy it all.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.350
The price is not an issue.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:11.380
Sorry.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.540
I know nothing
about the sources you mentioned,

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.570
and I can't procure those supplies.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.180
Mr. He,

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.000
are you feeling

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.400
being a business secretary is beneath you?

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.050
How about this?

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.580
As long as you can
find these supply sources for the company,

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:33.330
I'll promote you to procurement manager
immediately,

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.590

Double the salary,

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.010
plus additional year-end bonuses.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.160
Is that acceptable?

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.590
I'm sorry.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.220
I said I can't do it, and I truly can't.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.400
He's waiting for you inside.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.150
This way, please.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.500
Okay.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.090
Come.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:10.600
Come on! Get off, everyone!

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.220
Get off, get off, quickly!

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.280
All of you, look!

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.550
The 2 boats ahead—

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.960
unload all the grain from them

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.900
onto these two trucks!

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.090
Five people per boat!

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.070
The pay
is half a catty of rice per person!

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:23.050
You can get it after you finish the work!

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:24.030
Do you understand?

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.150
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.820
Get to work!

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:26.380
Okay!

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.800
Hurry up!

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.130
What's wrong, Master Huang?

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.240
Don't even ask.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.340
While crossing the Zhongshan blockade,

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.690
we were intercepted by the Japanese.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:46.950
Two dead, one injured.

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:53.530
Listen to me.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:55.940
Transporting some liquor for me
is one thing,

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.110
but transporting grain from Zhongshan
at a time like this?

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:02.510
You might not live long enough
to spend the money you've made.

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:07.170
Do you know
who these 2 boats' grain is for?

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:08.840
Who?

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:10.570
Mr. Ma from Hengfengyu.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.300
Every grain he's bought

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.520
is for disaster relief
and food distribution in Macau.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.960
Master Sanhe,

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.420
is there really no way
to transport more grain?

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:33.500
There are hundreds
of thousands of people in Macau.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.050
With just these 2 small boatloads of rice,

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:38.260
it won't even last 3 days
for refugee congee distribution.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.070
Master Sanhe.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:41.050
No matter what,

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:42.250
please think of a way.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.320
Name any price.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.250
I won't bargain.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.820
If it were only about money,

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.120
you wouldn't have needed to ask.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.040
Have a seat.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.610
Do you know
how big the risk Tai Ho Brotherhood took

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:55.900
and how much blood we shed

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.870
to transport those rice to Macau?

00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.790
So this business—

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:03.010
Tai Ho Brotherhood can only go this far.

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:06.600
-Give a hand.
-Yes, yes.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.490
Give a hand.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.130
Be careful.

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:12.440
Can you do it?

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:13.650
Yes. Yes.

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:16.540
Stack them neatly on the truck!

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.730
Actually, after this period,

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:22.050
things should get better.

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.780
But we still have to be careful.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.780
There's no other way.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.920
Here, be careful!

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:30.670
-Isn't that…
-What are you two doing?

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:31.800
-He Xian?
-Hurry up!

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.120
Why is he carrying goods here?

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:35.170
Give a hand!

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.190
Hey.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.960
Isn't this the great Mr. He?

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:45.050
Mr. He,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.320
these 2 boats
belong to our Tai Ho Brotherhood.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.190
So are you going to leave or stay

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.500
and continue to work?

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:54.820
If you alone

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:56.140
finish all of it,

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.460
the pay for 5 people

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:58.820
will all be yours.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.710
I'll do it.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.160
Officer Yang,

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.800
was this man really a bank owner before?

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.820
Yes.

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:27.340
Geez.

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:30.220
Now in Macau, just for a bite of food,

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.920
people have been pushed to such extremes.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:40.070
Sanhe, I'm back.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:40.920
Zhong,

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.050
why did you keep Mr. Ma waiting so long?

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.960
Zixia

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.260
got into a clash with someone.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.920
He insisted a laborer unload

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.500
an entire boat of grain alone.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.210
During this grain transport,

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.670
we lost quite a few men.

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.030
So Zixia

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.880
vented all his anger on him.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.070
It'll be done soon.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:58.760
In that case,

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.360
Master Sanhe, I won't delay further.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.500
If there are other ways
to transport grain here,

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.480
you must tell me.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.080
I'm willing to pay any price.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.010
Mr. Ma,

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.920
there's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.310
Please go ahead.

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:14.940
Right now in all of Macau,

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.190
there are
hundreds of thousands of starving people.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:18.360
In other words,

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.280
there are hundreds of thousands of people
waiting for food.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.810
What have you relied on
to hold out till today?

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:25.000
Yeah.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:28.860
To be honest,

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.150
I'm not insisting on being this stubborn.

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:34.940
But a friend of mine

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:37.000
taught me through his actions

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:40.210
that the most important thing in life
is to keep one's word

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:41.420
and act with conscience.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:42.480
I don't know

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.440
how much longer I can help

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.400
these hundreds of thousands of people
waiting for food.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.340
But I know

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:49.260
I must help them for as long as I can.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.530
Who is this friend of yours?

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:54.970
Funny thing is,

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.480
this friend and I share
a kind of spiritual connection.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.810
We've never met before.

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.010
Who's there?

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.340
It's me, Yang Chang.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.420
Here. Come.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.590
I brought this for you.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:25.090
Here.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.050
Here.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:32.460
Why are there just you guys?

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.610
Where are Mrs. Jones and James?

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.690
I'm asking you.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:43.930
Where are they?

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:51.610
If that's the case,

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:52.690
Tai Ho Brotherhood

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:54.380
benefited from your friend's kindness.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.460
Otherwise, the passengers back then
couldn't have disembarked.

00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.230
If you find this friend in the future,

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:01.570
you must introduce him to me.

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:02.340
No problem.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.210
I'll definitely introduce him to you
in the future.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.210
Mr. Ma, please.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.360
Is that okay?

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:25.320
Yes.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.590
Five portions of pay in total—

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:28.380
two and a half catties of rice.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:28.820
Here.

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.060
Master Huang,

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.690
I've finished moving all the cargo.

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:38.070
You have to keep your word.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:38.860
Don't worry.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:41.170
I'll keep my word.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:42.900
I will give it to you.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.860
Crawl between my legs,

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:54.640
and it's yours.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.910
Everyone's pressed for time.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:05.970
What do you say?

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.380
Crawl!

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:15.060
Master Huang!

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:20.630
Judging from his age,

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.760
he must have a family to support.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:23.670
He worked so hard

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:24.500
and did all the labor

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.800
so that his family
can have something to eat.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.460
I don't know
what happened between you two,

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.550
but there's no need
to give him such a hard time.

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:31.280
Zixia,

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.280
didn't you hear what Mr. Ma said?

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:49.780
Thank you.

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.550
Master Sanhe, I'm leaving!

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:52.650
Okay, take care.

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:00.430
[Hengfengyu]
