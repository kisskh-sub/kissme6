00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.220
I look horrible now, don't I?

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.120
Not really.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.540
It hurts, right?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.440
With you applying the medication on me,
it doesn't hurt.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.810
How is that possible?

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.600
I'm serious.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.340
Stop putting ointment on me and kiss me.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.590
Hey.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.320
I just applied the medicine.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.510
Tsk.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.630
Where are you going?

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.450
To sleep.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.920
Aren't you going to keep me company?

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.360
I can't hold it in.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.930
Then don't.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.140
No.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.320
I'll take good care of you.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.170
All of a sudden?

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.190
Yes.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.490
No one can touch you...

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.220
nor hurt you.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.090
You can touch me.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.520
Sleep in my room from now on.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.390
Rather than my own room?

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.310
If you want to stay in my house,
listen to me.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.690
Or else...

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.250
Or else...

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.630
I don't know.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.860
Let's sleep together in my room tonight.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.390
Whatever.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.770
Iljo!

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.760
I'm sorry. Was I being too noisy?

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.220
You don't have to clean anymore.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.730
I will have the cleaner come back.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.990
Why?

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.810
It's tiring.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.720
Go wash up quickly and get changed.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.450
We're heading out.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.990
Are we going somewhere?

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.880
Yes.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.680
Is there anything you want to do?

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.450
I just want to stay home.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.960
Hey...

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.600
What?

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.260
Does that make sense?

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.610
It's a nice day,
yet you just want to stay at home?

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.000
Tomorrow, the day after,
and the day after that, we'll be at home.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.800
Why stay at home?

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.720
Never mind.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.560
O-Okay.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.720
Let's go out.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.940
Hmm?

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:36.909
Let's go.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.400
Just so-so.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.540
Next.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.630
This is cute.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.580
Would you like to take this?

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.120
I'll take this.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.950
Is it good?

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.090
Yes. It's delicious.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.090
Why did you get it everywhere—

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.600
I-I'll clean it off myself.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.080
Okay.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.100
Ah, this is nice.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.430
Why?

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.230
It's too hot.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.210
Jeonghan, I need to use the restroom.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.900
Jeonghan.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.220
What?

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.860
What's wrong?

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.120
Let go.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.880
Do I embarrass you?

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.460
It's not like that.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.300
Are you embarrassed of me?

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.780
No.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.930
Yes, that's impossible.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.170
This is our first time.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.290
It's our first date outside.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.670
I'm sorry.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.040
But I don't like it

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.360
when I make things difficult for you.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.640
What if someone sees you?

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.020
Is that why... you said
you wanted to stay at home?

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.940
This is driving me crazy.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.690
Hey, what are you doing?

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.060
Get on.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.000
I'll give you 10 seconds.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.460
Ten.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.820
Nine.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.020
Eight.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.080
Three.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:24.880
Two.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.190
One.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.840
Hold tight.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.429
Don't fall off.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.760
I'm sorry.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.710
Were you really upset?

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.240
Yes.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.210
Was it this difficult

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.960
when you liked me?

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.330
There were more happy days
than difficult days.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.970
Gosh.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.400
This is what's bad about carrying you.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.670
What?

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.610
That I can't kiss you immediately
when I want to.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.520
Iljo.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.910
Yeah.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.020
You still like me, don't you?

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.130
Where's your answer?

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.640
Hey.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.730
Why aren't you answering me?

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.790
I'm saying, let's date.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.910
You'll regret losing me, you know?

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.000
Put me down.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.490
Answer me first.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.310
Do you think you can find someone else
as handsome as me?

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.720
Looks aren't everything.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.780
I'll make you
not want to step on the ground anymore.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.720
I can carry you all day.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.140
I like walking, though.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.520
I'll let you live in my house forever.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.850
No, no.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.650
Shall I just give you that house?

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.920
You can't buy people's hearts with money,
Jeonghan.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.780
Hey, Lee Iljo.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.160
If I lose you, I'll regret it.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.440
I know...

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.240
it's a little late now.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.620
But can you

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.660
give me another chance?

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.070
Please.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.820
Let's go inside.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.400
At least tell me the reason.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.050
Okay.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.600
Let's date.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.030
But

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.890
you have to promise me one thing.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.830
What is it?

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.350
Once we hurt each other...

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.910
We break up?

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.240
Yes.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.230
I don't want to be with you
with a wounded heart.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.000
Okay.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.560
I won't hurt you.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.610
But I have one condition.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.850
What is it?

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.840
You can't disappear without a word.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.130
Never again.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.200
Mm.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.030
Iljo.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.800
Yeah?

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.990
What kind of people did you date?

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.580
Just ordinary people.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.970
Well,

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.140
would they write you letters?

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.620
Mm.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.450
Were they handsome?

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.260
Mm.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.780
Hey.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.990
You're more handsome.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.860
Do you have any photos of your ex?

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.660
Mm.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.210
That's ridiculous.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:47.210
Pass me your phone.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.030
What are you doing?

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.050
I want to check if I'm the most handsome.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.960
I already said you're the most handsome.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.490
So show me.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.430
No.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.380
Why?

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.310
It's all in the past.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.770
Iljo.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.640
Are you asleep?

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.100
Let's get off together.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.940
I'll get off first.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.590
Look ahead.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.990
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.070
Hello. Good morning.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.380
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.300
You look more suspicious now.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.600
I'm leaving.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.160
Oh, Iljo.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.730
Mr. Jeonghan?

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.690
Did you two come to work together?

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.210
Yes.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.440
We live together.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.250
Huh?

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.990
Didn't know the two of you were close.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.060
What's your relationship?

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.020
We are...

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.370
Cousins.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.080
Yes, cousins.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.050
No wonder!

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.690
Both of you are so handsome.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.730
I have to go to work.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.280
I'll head in first.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.360
All the best!

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.150
All the best!

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.650
Why didn't you tell us?

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.589
I'm so jealous that you two live together.

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:12.460
Jealous? Of who?

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.990
Well...

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:18.200
By the way, is Iljo in a relationship?

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.540
Yes.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.050
With a super cool person.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.260
What about you?

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.630
I am, too.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.360
I'm so envious of your partners.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:32.400
Right?

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.360
The elevator door is opening.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.200
-It's pretty serious.
-Yeah.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.040
Good morning.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.030
Oh, Jeonghan.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.720
Seo Jeonghan,
did something good happen to you?

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.450
He said he's in a relationship.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.950
He's at the age of passionate love.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.140
Oh, go ahead.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.450
See you.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.770
[Seo Jeonghan:
I told my colleagues that I'm dating.]

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:15.920
I told my colleagues

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.620
that I'm dating.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.090
You really told everyone?

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.720
Three Iced Americanos
and two Iced Teas.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:54.950
Iljo.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.020
I heard you're dating.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.950
And that it's with a super cool person.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:02.280
Yeah...

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.240
It's 14,400 won.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.640
Today,

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:10.760
it's on me.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.500
Oh, nice!

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.480
We'll go take a seat first then.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.400
Okay.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.630
Let's go.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.830
Hey!

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.370
What are you doing?

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:38.990
Isn't it thrilling?

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.500
Come down after work.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.570
I'll wait for you at the parking lot.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:12.310
Why isn't he coming out?

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.650
You haven't cleaned that side yet.
Can you clean it properly?

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:16.760
You're the one who's not mopping it well.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.850
What are you talking about?

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.270
Your fingerprints are all over it.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.510
It's none of your business.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.690
Then clean it up properly.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.290
Jeonghan.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.820
Hello.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.280
Stop joking.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.810
What brings you here?

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.830
Can you please let part-timers
get off work on time?

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.130
I want to go home together with him.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:45.350
Hey!

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.040
Let's go, Iljo.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.420
Give me a second.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.090
Jeonghan.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:01.300
Why?

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.930
Do you feel uncomfortable?

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.930
People don't think too much about it.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.570
That's not what I meant...

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.360
Goodbye.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.030
Bye.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.620
See?

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.270
They don't care at all.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:18.810
Mm...

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.470
I'm having dinner with Suhyo today.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.420
Why?

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.920
Well, he's a friend.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.170
You...

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.730
Okay.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.200
It's okay?

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.530
Yes.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.640
I'm pretty chill in relationships.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.540
Got it.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.650
Call me.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.310
I'll pick you up.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.040
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.750
Go back first.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:58.680
Got it.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.120
I'll head off first.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.920
Lee Iljo, seriously...

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.710
Have you been here before?

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:25.880
No.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.410
What about you?

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.060
I've been here before.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.730
The vibe is good
and the food is delicious.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.330
What do you want to eat?

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.110
Anything is fine.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.190
When did you come?

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:53.450
About a month ago.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:54.460
With whom?

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.690
Just a few friends.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:57.450
I see...

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.480
You wanted soju, right?

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.520
Yeah. The vibe here is pretty nice.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.070
Right?

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.760
I've always wanted to bring you here.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.300
Thank you.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:11.710
How have you been?

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:13.120
Just so-so.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.600
Do you still live there?

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.920
Yeah...

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.300
It's better if you move out soon.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.170
Is it fine?

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.960
I don't have enough money
to pay rent with my part-time job.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.340
Would you like to work full-time, then?

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.520
Or work on the weekends too?

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.760
Really?

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.800
Yes.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.520
I'll take good care of you.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.080
Okay, I'll think about it.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.890
Okay.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.680
Hurry up and save up and move out.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.740
I don't like how that rascal's
been looking down on you.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.930
What do you mean, "that rascal"?

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.080
He kept teasing you.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:58.410
Actually,

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.620
we're dating.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.840
Huh?

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.530
Since when?

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:13.380
It hasn't been long.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:17.900
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.520
What's there to be sorry about?

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.880
So?

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.720
Are you happy?

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.630
Don't you like him?

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.650
I'm happy.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.870
I don't want to talk about this.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.590
But I'm a little worried.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.520
Anyone can tell
you're the only one who'll get hurt.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.680
It's fine.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.260
Still, I'm happy.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.070
Hey, Lee Iljo.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.340
Be careful.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.690
They might be behind this.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:14.000
Blood is thicker than water...

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.620
Suhyo.

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.370
Let's go.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.820
It's not even 10 PM yet.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.600
Jeonghan is waiting for me.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.630
Hey, Lee Iljo.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.990
You...

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.200
I'm sorry.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.070
Let's go.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.220
The bill, please.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.750
It's 27,000 won. Thank you.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.140
Thank you.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.150
Thank you for the meal, Suhyo.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.510
Jeonghan?

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:37.000
Why are you here?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.390
Hey, Lee Iljo. You smoke?

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.250
Why did you hide it?

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:47.820
I didn't mean to hide it.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.350
You just never asked.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:13.870
How was your meeting with that rascal?

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.800
What do you mean "that rascal"?

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.680
The two of you, seriously...

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.630
Why?

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.770
Does he call me "that rascal" too?

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.850
Forget it.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:31.760
What did you talk about?

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.020
It's a secret.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.930
Why did you come here?

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.600
What's wrong?

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.470
Come here.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.020
Huh?

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.180
I'm telling you
to come to the driver's seat.

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.760
I'll reward you.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.070
Hey.

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:11.450
Be careful.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:15.310
If you accidentally honk,
everyone in the neighborhood will wake up.

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.130
Don't take off my shirt...

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.940
[In the next episode]

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:06.890
I heard Iljo didn't come to work today.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:08.930
I heard he had to go to the hospital.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.550
The owner opened the cafe late today too.

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:14.650
Has Iljo been getting beaten up?

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:16.790
He keeps getting wounded.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:19.230
Lee Iljo.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.570
What is all this?

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:27.650
Jeonghan.

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:29.970
-I can explain—
-I'm asking you what is all this!
