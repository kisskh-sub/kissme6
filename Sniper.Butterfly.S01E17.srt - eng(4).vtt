(Brother)

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.690
Hello.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.330
What's wrong with you?

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.810
Why was your phone off?

00:02:08.844 --> 00:02:10.560
Do you know
how many times I called you?

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.590
Sorry, Sister.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.520
Just now in the car,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.711
my phone ran out of battery,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.080
and I didn't bring a charger.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.180
I just borrowed a power bank

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.190
and called you right away.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.360
Where are you now?

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.511
I have arrived in Yan City.

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:20.380
I'm at a hotel now.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.900
With Cheng Rui?

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.030
Wow.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.177
You're really something now.

00:02:26.222 --> 00:02:26.850
Impressive.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.850
Disappear right after sending a text.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.570
Don't you know I'd be worried?

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.500
Sorry.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.560
I was a bit anxious.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.030
I was mistaken.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.530
We gotta go.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.340
What's so urgent?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.780
Just...

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:44.955
Just that Cheng Rui has
some personal business.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.590
I'll find a chance

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.000
to tell you when I'm back, Sister.

00:02:48.044 --> 00:02:49.511
Did you bring enough money?

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.100
Be careful when you're outside.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.288
When will you come back?

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.970
Probably in a day or two.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.780
Here.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.570
Found her.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.800
Sister.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.750
I'll hang up first.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.730
Bye-bye.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.660
Tao Wanwen.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.870
Am I even

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.730
your best friend?

00:03:14.733 --> 00:03:16.820
Running away from home is huge,
and you didn't bring me?

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:17.250
Alright.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.960
When it comes to this kind of thing,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.100
can you beat me?

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.690
Do you know how much I suffered
because of you today?

00:03:23.955 --> 00:03:24.960
I wasn't even awake yet,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.711
and got surrounded by a roomful of elders.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.620
I'm almost traumatized.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.240
My mom even suspected

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.620
that I put you up to it.

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:33.220
She said that a well-behaved,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.460
and sensible girl like you,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.030
without some unreliable person

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.844
giving you bad ideas,
how else could you do

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:40.000
something that impulsive?

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.290
Totally ridiculous.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.730
I can't clear my name no matter what.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.010
It really was tough on you.

00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:50.120
But hiding away

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.190
from things you don't want

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.150
to face,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.290
I did learn that from you.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.430
You didn't tell them

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.955
you came to Yan City to find me, right?

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.620
Of course not.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.570
I just left a note,

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.030
saying I couldn't stand the injustice,

00:04:06.088 --> 00:04:07.355
and couldn't stay in that house

00:04:07.377 --> 00:04:08.570
for even a minute.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.660
But I did confide in my uncle.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.850
He promised to help us
hold them off for now

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.220
and not reveal our location.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.900
I know it'll throw the family
into chaos,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.820
but I had no choice.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.850
If I stayed home right now,

00:04:28.888 --> 00:04:29.920
they'd definitely drag me

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.720
back to the school

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.244
and force me to change my application.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.700
Exactly.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.360
Why did you suddenly

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.490
apply to Yanbei University?

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.850
It's not really "sudden".

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.850
Had you planned this all along?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.190
The NCEE is serious business.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.900
How could I act on impulse?

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.820
I hesitated for a long time.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.430
You all know

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.820
that ever since junior high school,

00:04:53.822 --> 00:04:55.270
"Yanbei University School of Medicine"

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.040
has been stuck

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.290
right in front of my desk.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.970
I know

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.610
that if I follow what they want

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.160
and walk

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.610
the path they planned for me,

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.970
the future

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.780
might be much easier.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.100
But as the NCEE got closer,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.444
the thought that I didn't want
to study medicine

00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:11.620
became clearer and clearer.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.730
Later, I figured it out.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.630
The choice itself

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.170
might not be that important at all,

00:05:21.222 --> 00:05:22.480
but compared to the bright future

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.930
the adults see in their eyes,

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.050
what I want

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.020
is more important.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.700
I always knew you had your own ideas,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.970
but I didn't expect them to be this big.

00:05:33.244 --> 00:05:33.720
As for me,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.020
I don't have any other requests.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.870
Just please,

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:36.950
if you ever have any ideas,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.120
tell me first thing.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.730
Okay?

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.340
Okay.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.750
Li Wu.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.600
You got accepted.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.170
Don't you want to visit Huaqing?

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.530
Can I go?

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.490
Of course.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.370
I'll take you there tomorrow.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.260
This school is huge.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.290
Hey, Wen.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.260
Take a photo for me.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.720
It's not even your university.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.100
Why are you taking pictures?

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.600
This is Huaqing.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.510
Just visiting once

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.730
is enough for me to brag about.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.700
Li Wu.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.020
Together.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.970
Wait, someone's coming.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.610
One, two, three.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.290
One, two, three.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.970
There's a bit of glare.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.870
It's fine.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.410
Let me see.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.820
Looks good.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.930
Li Wu.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.390
This is Huaqing.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.410
What do you think?

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.870
Actually, before coming to Yan City,

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.160
I was really anxious too.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.460
I didn't know whether my choice
was really the right one.

00:06:34.533 --> 00:06:35.920
But yesterday I followed the senior

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.070
and toured Yanbei University,

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.730
and I immediately felt
I had chosen well.

00:06:38.933 --> 00:06:40.390
Just thinking that I'll be living there

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.360
the next four years,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.020
I'm already super excited.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.390
I know you've also been unsure

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.720
about how to choose.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.510
So I thought

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.720
I'd bring you here

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.022
to feel Huaqing for yourself.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.580
It's really nice.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.950
What?

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.511
Why do you look like you're not really

00:06:55.533 --> 00:06:56.450
looking forward to it?

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.980
(Chang Bar)

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.720
Don't doze off.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.660
Help me check.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.510
Should I go to Phuket

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.490
or Fiji this time?

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:11.490
(Explore the world)
I've never been

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:12.870
to Fiji.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.820
I want to go too.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.190
Phuket is just very beautiful,

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.460
and there's a lot to do.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.120
I want to take two days off

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.377
and take Li Wu out to play.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.700
If you're free, come with us.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.820
I'm not free.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.430
Of course, go to Fiji.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.610
It's raining in Phuket now.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.290
True.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.170
I saw that there are
diving activities over there.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.050
I want to take him to try it.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.750
But I don't know if Li Wu

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:41.730
can swim.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.530
Is Fiji visa-free?

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.100
Let me check.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.720
Ask him

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.680
whether he can swim.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.140
Why are you asking me?

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.120
I haven't even slept enough

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.070
and you dragged me up.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.900
You heartless woman.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.290
He's not here.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.220
Right.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.410
Speaking of this, it's really strange.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:02.600
Some time ago,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.920
I saw him being indecisive

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.930
about choosing his major.

00:08:05.111 --> 00:08:05.750
I even wanted

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.066
to take him to visit some schools.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.070
But then without a word,

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.930
he went to Yan City with his classmates.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.430
I asked him what he went for,

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.730
and he couldn't explain clearly.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.490
Kids grow up.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.170
They have their own ideas.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.460
Exactly.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.560
Li Wu has already grown up.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.190
He finished the NCEE.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:22.870
At his age,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.610
it's normal to hang out with friends.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.870
Didn't you ask whether

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.780
he went with boys or girls?

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.670
He said he went out

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:34.490
with Cheng Rui.

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:36.910
When he comes back tonight,

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:37.770
I'll ask again.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.120
Right.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.910
He only told me
he would be back tonight.

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:41.850
He didn't say what time,

00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:42.850
so I can go pick him up.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.250
Aren't you managing him a bit too much?

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.240
Men don't like women

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.650
who manage them this much.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.720
Stop using your so-called

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.080
dating experience to brainwash me.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.270
This is my soon-to-be
Huaqing University-going brother.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.580
He's still a man.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.240
(Brother: Sister.)

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.920
(Received 100,000 yuan)
(I've decided to apply for)

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.890
(Yijiang University's computer science.
I've already submitted my choices today.)

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.890
What's wrong?

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.300
Where are you?

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:15.820
Just got home.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.670
What's with the 100,000 yuan?

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.666
Where did it come from?

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:27.155
Yijiang University gave it.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.370
A full scholarship.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.340
What did you say?

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.580
I told you before

00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:37.180
that Yijiang University
contacted me long ago.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.220
What about Huaqing then?

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.770
I'm not going.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.420
Not going?

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.730
Why aren't you going to Huaqing?

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.420
No.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.120
Stop fooling around.
Your score can...

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.010
I'm not fooling around.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.180
I'm serious.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.180
Yijiang University is giving me
a full scholarship,

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.610
tuition and fees waived.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.850
And they promise
guaranteed admission to grad school.

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:02.750
A professor already contacted me.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:03.480
I also told him

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.650
the research direction I want.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.670
Anyway, I'll study there first.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.480
If I can go straight to a PhD
in senior year,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.080
then I'll...

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.540
No.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.100
I don't agree.

00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:48.510
I already visited Yijiang University
this afternoon.

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:54.000
The admissions teacher

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.010
showed me around.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.180
I...

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.220
I really like it.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.580
And...

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.650
I've already submitted everything.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.130
You've already submitted it?

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.010
Li Wu, you're unbelievable.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.840
Such a big decision

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.340
and you made it all by yourself!

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:25.890
When did you come home today?

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.220
You left without saying,

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.000
and you submitted without saying.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.030
What do you take me for?

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.840
You could've gone
to a better university.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.244
Why choose Yijiang University?

00:11:34.466 --> 00:11:35.755
You've seen Huaqing.

00:11:35.777 --> 00:11:37.390
The top university in the country.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.022
Isn't it better than Yijiang University?

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.890
What are you thinking?

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.840
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.850
I didn't suddenly change my mind.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.550
I've always known

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:47.600
what I want.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.650
What do you want?

00:11:49.977 --> 00:11:51.360
I was helping you, you know.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.750
Analyzing Huaqing's majors for you.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.130
Planning your holiday trips.

00:11:54.244 --> 00:11:56.250
Do you think tricking me is fun?
Is that so?

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.320
No.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:57.940
I...

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.540
I want to stay in Yi City

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.577
and study at Yijiang University.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.890
Why must you stay here?

00:12:19.733 --> 00:12:21.820
I want to become independent
as soon as possible...

00:12:26.044 --> 00:12:28.466
And pay you back,
as well as Mr. Cen and Mrs. Cen.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.355
Also, I've thoroughly researched

00:12:33.355 --> 00:12:35.050
Yijiang University's
Computer Science program.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.240
After I go there, I also want
to consider their AI program.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.244
Who told you that you have
to be independent now?

00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:40.580
Am I rushing you to pay me back?

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.490
Are my parents rushing you?

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:44.730
No.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.750
Let's go to the school now.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.700
We'll find Mr. Qi.

00:12:47.755 --> 00:12:49.466
See if there's still a way
to reverse this.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:50.770
I'm not going.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.490
What is wrong with you?

00:12:52.666 --> 00:12:54.080
For such a small amount of money,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.911
you're giving up such
a good opportunity?

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.370
You're still young.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.511
You can't just look
at what's right in front of you

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.940
and act impulsively.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.610
This is about your future.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.650
You'll regret it one day.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:23.820
I'm not young anymore.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.180
And I really thought it through.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.300
And it's not just because of the money.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.030
I have my own reasons.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.460
Then what are your reasons?

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.820
Anyway, you told me before.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.720
From now on, my life

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.750
can be written by myself.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:45.970
That was your blessing for me.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.300
So you mean

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.180
I have no right to interfere?

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.240
That's not what I meant.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.355
Then what did you mean?

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.700
Say something.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.130
After all this time together,

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.250
you never changed.

00:14:19.977 --> 00:14:21.844
You still treat me like an outsider.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.030
Not even willing

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.244
to tell me your real reason.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.220
Fine.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.100
Then go.

00:14:41.511 --> 00:14:43.333
No one here wants to control you.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.700
(Date. Income. Expenses. Notes)

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.900
(Fiji)

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:28.340
(Fiji)

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.300
Sister.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.370
I've put all the records of my expenses

00:18:04.444 --> 00:18:06.688
for food, lodging, and transport
after coming to Yi City

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.170
on the desk in the study.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.740
And also,

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.820
the things you bought me...

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:21.880
I've included

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.930
all the prices I know.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:27.200
And the 30,000 yuan

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.060
you gave to my uncle...

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.130
Adding everything together,

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.890
I don't even know if 100,000 yuan
is enough.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.580
If it's still not enough,

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.020
just tell me.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.780
I'll find a way to repay it all later.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.300
Fine.

00:18:56.244 --> 00:18:58.711
You've wanted to settle things
with me for a long time, right?

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.890
Then why call me sister?

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:09.690
You've grown wings now.

00:19:10.888 --> 00:19:12.060
You don't need me anymore.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.740
Then go.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.340
Sister.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:38.640
Thank you

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.155
for taking care of me this past year.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.650
Li Wu, what's wrong with you?

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:38.930
The group chat exploded.

00:20:39.911 --> 00:20:41.750
They're all talking about
you giving up Huaqing

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.333
and choosing Yijiang University.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:44.510
It's up to Li Wu

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.130
which school he applies to.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:47.650
It has nothing to do with others.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:52.450
What "others"?

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.880
Am I "others" to him?

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.210
I'm his best bro!

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.260
Li Wu.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.170
Don't tell me you stayed
because you couldn't bear to leave me.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.100
Where are you?

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.850
Did you run away from home, too?

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:11.260
You...

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.210
And you.

00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:15.488
I don't even know
what to say about you two.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:16.340
Li Wu,

00:21:16.688 --> 00:21:18.060
what are you going to do now?

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.100
Go find a hotel to stay first.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.030
You gave up Huaqing,

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.540

She's also doing it for your good.

She's still angry right now.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.540
She'll calm down eventually.

00:21:31.422 --> 00:21:32.850

I'll help you think of a solution.

Hello, Mr. Qi.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.650
I heard you decided to apply
to Yijiang University.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.500
Right.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.680
Your sister left something with me

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.133
and asked me to give it to you.

you moved out.

will have a meal with you.

I just suddenly wanted
to eat your cooking.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.480
Where's Dad?

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.755

How's his university application going?

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.200
Does he need to hear

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.450
your dad's and my opinion?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:40.960
No need.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.260
He knows exactly what he wants.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.100
He got a full scholarship.

00:26:44.244 --> 00:26:45.911
He already applied to Yijiang University.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.060
He decided so quickly.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:51.650
Who knows what he's thinking?

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:53.410
Alright.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.667

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:55.866
As long as he's decided.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.444
How come I didn't see you
being happy for him?

How can I be happy?

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:02.911
He could get into Huaqing

00:27:02.933 --> 00:27:04.530
but insists on going
to Yijiang University.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.300
What's wrong with Yijiang University?

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.450
You graduated from Yijiang University.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.260
Why are you looking down on it now?

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.880
He wants to study science.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.580
Huaqing is the best for science.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.890
You don't understand.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.020
I don't understand?

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.780
When you applied for university,

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.930
you said you wanted to study journalism.

00:27:24.066 --> 00:27:26.622
Didn't your dad want to register you
for Yanbei University?

00:27:26.733 --> 00:27:27.580
And what did you say?

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.450
"Too far from home. I'm not going."

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.310
Now he's not going,

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.500
and suddenly you're unhappy.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.350
How can he be the same as me?

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:35.890
What's different?

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.310
As long as the school is decided,

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:39.650
why care what he applies for?

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.340
You're not his real sister.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.066
You can't take care of him forever.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.130
Jin is back.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.340
Dad.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.410
You argued with Wu

00:27:51.866 --> 00:27:53.370
because of the application issue.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:55.410
You already knew?

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:01.930
Wu

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.060
sent me a message,

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.200
and said he applied
to Yijiang University.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:08.820
That kid is quick with words.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.750
Eat.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:13.690
Don't let it get cold.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.410
Jin, eat first.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.820
Jin.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.930
What's that scholarship

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.980
you just mentioned about?

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.440
He transferred 100,000 yuan,

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.690
saying he wants to pay us back.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:43.240
Did we send him to school

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.690
just to get our money back?

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.240
Why is he in such a hurry?

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.340
He's giving up his future.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:52.210
Well.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.720
This is only

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.780
from our perspective.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.650
But Wu

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.850
is a kid who repays kindness.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.450
From his perspective,

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:02.830
receiving help

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:03.980
always means you owe someone.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.890
Right?

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.240
How can he interact with others

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.410
freely and equally?

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.590
He has always been mature and sensible.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:13.720
Since he chose this,

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.170
he must have thought it through.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:17.100
It wouldn't be just for the money.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.370
I know you care about him.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:28.590
But we also

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:30.300
need to respect his choice.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:31.410
Right?

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:36.880
As for that money,

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.830
just keep it first.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.800
If you don't take it,
he won't feel at ease.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.300
My uncle

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.130
is truly a rare flower

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.780
in our family of businesspeople.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:54.750
My grandma had three children,

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:55.740
and he's the only son.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.640
But he just has no interest

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.450
in doing business,

00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:59.880
and refuses to take over

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.850
the family business.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:01.820
Look.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.450
He's running off to do

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.450
environmental research.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:07.650
Day after day,

00:30:07.711 --> 00:30:09.030
he's shut inside the institute.

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:10.170
We don't even see him.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.020
For example,

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.210
Uncle.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.350
Why did you come

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:21.610
without telling me?

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:23.300
This is Li Wu.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.310

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:26.930
and extremely easygoing uncle.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.060
Hello, Mr. Shen.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:28.820
Hello.

00:30:29.066 --> 00:30:30.480
Cheng Rui always talks about you.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.777
I've heard so much about you.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.100
Let's go.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.533
I'll take you to see the dorm first.

00:30:35.555 --> 00:30:36.044
Okay.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.410
Let's go.

Please come in.

00:30:48.133 --> 00:30:49.030
I haven't tidied up,

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.133
so it's a bit messy.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.550

you can stay here comfortably.

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:54.550

if you need anything.

Thank you, Mr. Shen.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.130
Just stay here and settle in.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:03.160
My uncle

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.170
is really a good person.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:06.300
Then,

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.650

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.270
This dormitory

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:15.650
is provided solely for me,

00:31:15.822 --> 00:31:16.890
not rented out to others.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.850
But I usually don't stay here either.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.210
So I won't charge you rent.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.070
If I'm really busy,

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.666
I might squeeze in here sometimes.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.000
You can help me

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.300
pay for utilities.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.210
Alright.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.160
I'll add you on WeChat.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.133
I'll transfer it to you.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.640
Uncle, how come you still...

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.510
I heard from Cheng Rui

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.300
that you need to find a part-time job.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.590
Our institute

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:39.690
happens to need interns.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:40.510
Take a look.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:41.300
Consider it.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:43.410
Sure.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:45.020
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:45.780
Okay.

00:31:45.822 --> 00:31:47.400
Then I'll go back
to the institute first.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.850
If you need anything else,

00:31:49.422 --> 00:31:50.980
ask Cheng Rui to go buy it with you.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:52.340
I'm off.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:54.410
Goodbye, Mr. Shen.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.170
Bye.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:31:59.200
The place

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.500
and part-time job are settled.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.820
Now you can relax.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.500
(Sister)

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.680
(I've decided to apply for
Yijiang University's computer science.)

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.780
(August 2nd, Sister's birthday)

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:55.380
(Girls' birthday gift)

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:04.850
Cheng Rui.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.340
What's a suitable gift

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.410
for a girl's birthday?

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.890
Who's having a birthday?

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:21.980
Your sister?

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.540
Smart thinking.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.370
Maybe you can use
this chance to reconcile.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.680
I'll ask Wen for you.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.780
She's a girl, and she'll know
what touches the heart.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.820
I'll ask for you.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:41.400
She sent me several links.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.466
I'll forward them to you.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.020
Take a look.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:48.940
(Cheng Rui)

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.140
(Product detail page)

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.930
Do you know what brands

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.980
your sister usually likes?

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.450
I recognize them,

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:09.060
but I don't remember the names.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.380
Happy Birthday.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:52.330
Sister.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.020
Li Wu, it's raining.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.060
Close the bedroom window.

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:48.460
Li Wu, did you hear me?

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.170
Li Wu.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.250
(Li Wu: Sister.)

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:16.210
(Happy Birthday.)

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.100
(Wish you more and more happiness.)

00:38:36.333 --> 00:38:37.577
(Sister: Got the gift.)

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:38.500
(Thank you.)

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.130
(Li Wu: Sorry.)

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.860
(Sorry.)

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:37.810
Sister.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:40.500
Why are you here?

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.360
Starting tomorrow,

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.880
I'll spend one day a week

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.955
working part-time
at the milk tea shop next door.

00:39:48.955 --> 00:39:50.580
Giving up Huaqing to work here...

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.060
Are you out of money?

00:39:52.133 --> 00:39:54.466
No money but still bought
such an expensive gift for me.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.710
It's your birthday.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.690
I want to give you something useful.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.420
Do you have the budget for this?

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.960
Work hard to earn money to buy this.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.770
Is it worth it?

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.230
It would be better to buy more books.

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.000
Even a tablet would be better than this.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:12.730
Sister.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:20.210
I'm sorry.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.580
I know you're still angry.

00:40:24.155 --> 00:40:25.760
I also know that you don't really care

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.222
at all about the money I repaid you.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:29.730
But, about applying
to Yijiang University,

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.460
I really researched it carefully.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.480
Yijiang University has been involved
in artificial intelligence for a long time.

00:40:35.488 --> 00:40:37.280
Previously awarded
AI behavioral learning models

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.400
were also developed there.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.380
Their faculty in this area
is really excellent.

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:42.290
And...

00:40:43.066 --> 00:40:43.880
Computer science

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.250
is also a field I'm interested in.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:48.210
I've really

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:51.500
considered it carefully.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.250
You researched so much.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:55.150
Then, earlier,

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:56.822
when I was helping you analyze choices,

00:40:56.844 --> 00:40:57.844
why didn't you tell me?

00:40:57.888 --> 00:40:58.330
I...

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.130
was afraid you wouldn't agree.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.110
Afraid I wouldn't agree,

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:07.622
so you acted first and reported later.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.130
Sister.

00:41:13.711 --> 00:41:14.800
The care you've shown me

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.810
during this time,

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.030
I can never

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.900
fully repay.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.110
If I had told you

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:21.288
about my choices in advance,

00:41:21.333 --> 00:41:23.060
you'd have asked me
to prioritize my future.

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:24.980
But now, through my efforts,

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.810
I can go to the university I like,

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.440
study the major I want,

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.730
and support myself.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.170
So...

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:33.540
I don't want to owe you any more.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:37.710
But I've never treated you

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:38.610
as an outsider.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.770
I just...

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:44.420
Just...

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.940
I really feel that you
are very important to me.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:53.690
That's why I want

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.690
to start doing things for you earlier.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:59.940
Sounds nice.

00:42:00.533 --> 00:42:02.420
How much can part-time work
really achieve?

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.190
And don't think

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:06.800
that university means no more studying.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:07.840
Going to university

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.510
is actually a new start in life.

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:10.290
Rest assured.

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:11.150
I will

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:12.290
continue to study hard.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.060
Li Wu.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.730
This choice is yours.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.280
Just don't regret it.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.100
That's enough.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:26.500
I won't regret it.

00:42:38.288 --> 00:42:40.330
Why are you standing there?
Aren't you going home?

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.770
Can I go back?

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.420
Let's go.

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:48.250
Sister.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:50.330
What now?

00:42:51.933 --> 00:42:53.355
If you get tired in the future,

00:42:53.355 --> 00:42:54.130
I can drive.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:57.210
I got my license.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.550
You're really capable now.

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:01.130
You can handle everything yourself.

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:04.500
Not everything can be handled.

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:07.290
Then what can't you handle?

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.290
Handling a sister's anger.

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:15.250
Alright.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:16.380
But no need.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.810
Why?

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.940
My car has restrictions.
