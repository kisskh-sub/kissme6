Grandmother and the others

are praying in the main hall.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.220
She asked me to fetch you.

It's fine.

Young Master Xie.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.780
What a coincidence.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.100
Why are you here as well?

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.436
Since fate ties me to Young Master Xie,

00:03:40.437 --> 00:03:41.877
of course I would be here.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.780
I have no time for your infatuation.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.939
Yan,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.940
let's go.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.540
Why do you get to take him away?

00:03:50.562 --> 00:03:52.486
Su Jinyuan, let me remind you,

00:03:52.487 --> 00:03:54.127
you are his sister-in-law,

00:03:54.237 --> 00:03:55.797
not his wife.

00:04:01.487 --> 00:04:03.219
I need no reminder.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.580
I know it well.

00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:18.735
Yunyan.

00:04:19.912 --> 00:04:21.992
I spoke no lie.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.900
Come with me.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.950
I have words for you.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.540
Yunyan, wait for me.

00:04:33.062 --> 00:04:37.632
(Imperial Commissioned Puji Temple)

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.659
Yunyan,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.179
why walk so fast?

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.060
You bumped right into me.

00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:53.539
Yunyan,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.599
did you misunderstand me?

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.076
I have admired you for long.

00:04:57.077 --> 00:04:58.036
I was anxious earlier

00:04:58.037 --> 00:04:59.197
and spoke rashly.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.980
Look,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.974
I even prepared a gift

00:05:01.975 --> 00:05:03.707
for Yunyan for the Ghost Festival.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.660
Please forgive me.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.657
Su Xinyue,

00:05:13.762 --> 00:05:15.122
I'm warning you.

00:05:15.187 --> 00:05:16.827
Stay away from the Xiao family.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.220
Otherwise,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.900
don't blame me
for being rude to the Su family.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.299
Yunyan,

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.219
please forgive me.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.739
My feelings for you are true.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.779
This is a sacred place.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.620
Mind your manners.

00:05:41.087 --> 00:05:42.407
Su Jinyuan,

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.740
I will marry into the Xiao family.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.282
And one day,
I'll grind you beneath my feet.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.980
As long as

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.380
Xie Yunyan still lives,

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.660
the Xiao case will never be closed.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.820
He

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.660
must die.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.780
But that Su Jinyuan

00:06:11.842 --> 00:06:13.041
keeps meddling,

00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:14.386
ruining our plans.

00:06:14.387 --> 00:06:15.859
Unless she's gone,

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.259
there's no way

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
to draw Xie Yunyan into our trap.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.739
Otherwise, no matter how we scheme,

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.940
we won't get a clean shot at him.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.424
It's just that...

00:06:30.425 --> 00:06:31.739
Just that what?

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.299
Su Xinyue,
the younger sister of Su Jinyuan,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.482
once tried to marry in place of her.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.380
The two are bitter enemies
because of it.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.259
And she seems
quite taken with Xie Yunyan.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.420
Maybe we

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.100
can make use of that.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.180
Then let us give her a little help.

00:06:54.862 --> 00:06:56.099
First, remove

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.700
Su Jinyuan.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.900
May our ancestors watch over us.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.860
These days have been hard
on Jinyuan as well.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.860
Come, let's go.

00:07:43.287 --> 00:07:44.487
You're not leaving?

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.059
I want to set a lantern

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.820
for my parents and my brother too.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.700
Father.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.300
Mother.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.100
Luo.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.260
If there is a next life,

00:08:27.037 --> 00:08:29.677
may you all live safe and peaceful.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.100
What brings you back?

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.580
I've been thinking.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.419
If that day,

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.380
I hadn't met you at the cliff,

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.180
and you didn't stop me
from fighting Luo Yu,

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.140
if we never returned to the capital,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.480
never returned to the Xiao family,

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.299
what kind of person

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.900
would I be now?

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.940
Don't dwell on what never happened.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.020
What matters now

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.980
is to keep moving forward.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.220
Thank you.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.859
For pulling the Xiao family

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.340
back from the brink.

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:40.819
Because I met you,

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.540
I could...

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.100
You are my sister-in-law.

00:10:01.725 --> 00:10:02.885
I will respect you,

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.660
and protect you.

00:10:17.437 --> 00:10:18.597
(Only)

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.780
(I must not love you.)

00:10:32.987 --> 00:10:34.086
I heard that

00:10:34.087 --> 00:10:35.299
these river lanterns,

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.460
the farther they drift,

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.299
the farther our thoughts

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.820
and blessings will go.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.060
Then let us hope

00:10:50.887 --> 00:10:52.647
for peace and smooth days,

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.260
and each find our own happy ending.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.260
The moon waxes and wanes,
flowers bloom then fall.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.900
What ending is ever truly perfect?

00:11:24.062 --> 00:11:26.262
All wishes are born from the heart.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.060
Yet life seldom keeps faith with us.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.540
It seems this wish

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.460
is beyond what a lantern can carry.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.340
If it cannot carry it,

00:11:57.737 --> 00:11:59.817
then let it sink.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.107
Everything that happened
after the Xiao case,

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.820
I have told you already.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.659
It was Young Lady Su and Xie Yunyan
who held the Xiao family together,

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.020
sharing hardship side by side.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.700
It is natural they have grown close.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.739
When you return...

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.620
Young Lady Xi.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.500
I, Xiao Yunxi,

00:12:35.512 --> 00:12:37.232
am not someone so shallow.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.580
Besides,

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.499
Jinyuan and I

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.300
never truly became husband and wife.

00:12:48.775 --> 00:12:50.455
My days are numbered.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.420
Why make her grieve for me again?

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.380
Yunxi.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.980
I am a Divine Physician.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.579
I will cure you,

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.500
you have my word.

♪At the far edge of the tides
I waited long for you♪

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:04.740
♪Seasons washed away by ebb
and flow but still I never left♪

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:11.379
♪A gentle breeze slips
through mirage and illusion♪

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:17.420
♪When the sea calms after the storm
I will see you turning back♪
