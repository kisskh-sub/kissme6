[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 22]

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.550
Wen Yueqian, you're courting death.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.920
Let me tell you,

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.960
if I could beat you once,

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.710
I can do it again.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.550
I won't let you off.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.040
Then let's wait and see.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.920
Father, now Su Guang is dead,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.540
and the account book is gone.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.670
How can I seek justice for you?

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.800
Why are you drinking alone?

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.230
It's none of your business.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.890
Tonight, only I keep you company.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.270
Shouldn't you pour me a drink?

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.190
As your sister-in-law, I have
to keep our distance.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.800
You didn't know that?

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.440
I came to bring you some pastries.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.520
I don't want your things.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.480
I have the pastries
my husband gave me.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.550
You're drunk. Let's head back.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.870
In the middle of the night
instead of sleeping,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.840
why are you bothering my wife?

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.000
She was drinking alone at night.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.800
I just saw she was lonely,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.070
so I came to keep her company.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.230
Young Master Qi, someone's here
to pick me up.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.520
Well played, Wen Yueqian.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.480
You actually drank with Wanyan Qi.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.400
What do you take me for?

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.800
Jin.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.400
Give me a smile.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.230
Jin,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.070
you're not really angry, are you?

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.290
You drank alone
in the middle of the night.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.000
Afraid I would worry enough about you?

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.270
So you were worried about me.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.880
Then you can tell me directly.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.360
Why beat around the bush?

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.320
You're drunk.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.480
I'm not drunk.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.630
Smell me.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.400
I'm your husband.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.590
If you want to drink,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.400
I can keep you company.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.400
You are really nice.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.230
Qingran,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.670
go home first and sober up.

you don't follow the rules.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.110
Who was holding my arm last night,
refusing to let go?

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.270
Wen Yueqian,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.440
you must have forgotten.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.670
You're now my wife.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.840
Whether I become your wife
depends on my choice.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.150
Why have you brought me here?

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.150
Brought you?

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.880
That word sounds so harsh.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.630
I'm only trying to warn you,

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.710
the lady you serve is not
the real Su Qingran.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.880
She's an impostor.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.590
I'm the real lady of the Su Family.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.070
You should be loyal to me.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.360
If you follow me,

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.520
I promise you'll enjoy
endless wealth and honor.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.330
Don't think that just because
you have His Highness's favor now,

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.270
you can look down on Lady Qingran.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.480
You

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.670
aren't worthy.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.920
I advise you to think carefully.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.710
After all, she's just a fake.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.400
The day I expose her will be her end.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.150
As a servant,

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.320
you need to choose wisely.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.750
Pick the right tree to rest under.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.960
Go on and chase your Fool's Dream.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.320
From your reaction,

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.360
you already knew she was a fake.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.040
Since that's the case,

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.480
why not team up with me?

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.670
Let's expose her together.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.670
What do you say?

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.550
Are you out of your mind?

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.840
Hold her down for me.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.630
What are you doing?

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.840
Even if you kill me,

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.360
I will never betray Lady Qingran.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.880
What a loyal servant!

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.710
Don't worry.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.670
I'm not willing to kill you.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.190

Lady Qingran...

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.550
It was Su Feiyi who did this to you.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.990
I will go and kill her right now.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:06.590
don't...

Su Feiyi

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.270
has set a trap,

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.150
waiting for you.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.520
Cuihua, hold on. Hold on.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.000
I won't let this go.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.230
I'll go get the physician.

don't waste your efforts on me.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.750
Su Feiyi

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.400
knows your real identity.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.110
She intends to harm you.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.480
You must be very careful.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.710

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.190

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.550
When did you find out

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.400
about my real identity?

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.150
All these years,

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.270
no one ever treated me like a person.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.320
Only you...

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.750
Only you have cared for me.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.440
Keep this with you.
