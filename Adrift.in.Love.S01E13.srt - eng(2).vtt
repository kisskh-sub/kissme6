WEBVTT

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:05.087
Have you thought about where you want to go?

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:07.132
Tainan.

00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:08.636
Tainan.

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:12.063
Is there a place farther away?

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.572
Kinmen.

00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:17.944
What about it?

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:24.431
How about we go to New Zealand?

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:27.610
Don't joke around.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.593
I'll take it seriously.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.566
I'm serious.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:49.048
This is for you.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.527
I quit smoking.

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:54.691
Why?

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:04.319
I no longer need to smoke.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:08.055
Really?

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.089
You're too much.

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.023
Last smoke.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.804
I don't want it.

00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:14.894
[Episode 13: Will you still love me tomorrow?]

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:27.689
Why are you still at the office so late?

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.650
Yes, I have some unfinished work.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.610
I'm here to work overtime.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.155
What about you? Why are you still here so late?

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.365
I'm here to see Xin Tong.
Have you seen her?

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:39.742
Of course not.

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:40.826
What's wrong with her?

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:41.828
I don't know.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.747
She just disappeared,
and I can't reach her by phone.

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:46.124
Did you two have a fight?

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:47.375
Girls are like that.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:50.795
Just comfort her a little and she'll be fine.

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:52.881
I'm tired from working overtime.

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:55.007
Don't stay out too late.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:57.957
Don't stay out too late.

00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:01.138
Go home early.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:09.123
Don't look at me like that.

00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:11.463
Do you think I really want to be the bad guy?

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.504
You're scared?

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:17.005
I'm more scared than you, okay?

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.051
I just met Yi Fu.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.969
He scared me to death.

00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:25.768
Yi Fu will definitely come for me.

00:04:25.768 --> 00:04:27.687
Let me go.

00:04:27.687 --> 00:04:29.397
I won't tell him.

00:04:29.397 --> 00:04:30.440
What do you want?

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.400
You think I'm afraid of Xin Yi Fu?

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.028
Do you think I got to this position today
all because of my sister?

00:04:35.028 --> 00:04:37.906
And my nephew can just walk all over me, right?

00:04:37.906 --> 00:04:40.378
Let me tell you, that's not true.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.954
Yes, that's right.

00:04:44.954 --> 00:04:47.582
I got to where I am today because of my sister.

00:04:47.582 --> 00:04:50.168
But my sister thinks I'm an idiot.

00:04:50.168 --> 00:04:52.212
She thinks I'm an idiot, you know?

00:04:52.212 --> 00:04:55.632
She just wants her son to be the successor.

00:04:55.632 --> 00:04:58.381
After all this time, what am I?

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.049
No one in the company respects me.

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.135
No one listens to me during my presentation.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:06.013
He looks down on me, she looks down on me,
everyone looks down.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:09.471
Do you look down on me too?

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.854
I don't look down on you.

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.314
Just let me go.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.058
I won't call the police or tell anyone.

00:05:20.194 --> 00:05:23.071
Do you think I'm a three-year-old?

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.366
If...

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:27.201
If I let you go, you'll call the police.

00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:29.037
If you do, I'll be ruined.

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:31.456
I'll be ruined. My life will be ruined.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:34.751
My life will be ruined.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.420
You're Xin Yi Fu's uncle.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.589
We're family.

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:43.343
If I send you to jail,
what will I tell Xin Yi Fu?

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:46.095
I won't tell anyone.

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:48.592
I won't tell anyone.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:51.032
Good.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.159
You've finally thought it through.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.358
Let me tell you about Zhou Xiao Qi.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.485
She's nothing.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:01.986
Why did you listen to her?

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.529
You're going against me because of her.

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:04.989
Our whole family hates you.

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:06.741
Why did you do it?

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:10.244
Yes, I was stupid to help Zhou Xiao Qi.

00:06:10.244 --> 00:06:12.746
I won't get anything.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:16.167
I really love Yi Fu.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.060
I really love Yi Fu.

00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:21.798
Can you talk to Qian Li Hua for me?

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:24.050
Ask her to accept me.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.928
Then I'll give you the evidence.

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:29.582
I'll give you the evidence.

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:35.520
Okay, I promise you.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.147
As long as you give it to me,

00:06:38.147 --> 00:06:40.608
we can become family, right?

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:43.319
Our whole family will
welcome you with open arms.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.530
I'm going to get you the evidence now.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.989
I'll get it for you now.

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:50.117
Okay, I'll let you go.

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.087
I'll let you go.

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.832
I'll let you go.

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.992
Give it to me.

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.003
Then everything will be resolved.

00:07:01.003 --> 00:07:02.338
Everything will be fine.

00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:04.423
Give it to me.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.389
You lied to me!

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.099
You lied to me!

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.435
You lied to me!

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.978
You lied to me!

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.314
Damn it!

00:07:20.314 --> 00:07:22.066
You made me do this!

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:24.527
Damn you! You lied to me!

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.320
I didn't want to kill you.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.198
You made me do it. You made me kill you!

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.880
Bastard!

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.806
Help!

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:55.725
Don't run!

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.851
Help! Stop the car!

00:07:58.686 --> 00:08:00.475
Stop the car!

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:06.068
Help! Someone's trying to kill me!

00:08:06.068 --> 00:08:08.279
Sis!

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.573
Please, Sis! Save me!

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.908
Otherwise, I'll go to jail.

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:16.412
Sis!

00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:18.498
Get up.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.957
Look at yourself.

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:29.383
I really can't understand
why you did such a stupid thing.

00:08:29.383 --> 00:08:32.428
I didn't know Pan Xin Tong was so scheming.

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:34.347
She even pretended to compromise
and lied to me.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.848
Damn it!

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:39.264
You just ruined my perfect plan.

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.815
Where is Pan Xin Tong now?

00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:46.989
I don't know!

00:08:58.178 --> 00:09:01.241
[Yi Fu]

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.377
You're awake.

00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:48.004
I'll get the doctor for you.

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.021
No, I don't want that.

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:57.968
Are you all right? Do you feel unwell?

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.698
It's fine now.

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:24.456
Yi Fu!

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.876
- Yi Fu!
- What are you...

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:28.419
What are you doing?

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:30.588
You have no respect!

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:31.672
- Stop fighting!
- Sis!

00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:33.633
If you have the guts, don't hide behind my mom!

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.509
- Sis!
- That's enough, Yi Fu.

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:37.303
Your uncle knows he was wrong.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.804
Beating him to death won't help.

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:39.889
Mom!

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:41.599
You can't keep letting Uncle
get away with this!

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:42.975
He's just relying on you to protect him.

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:44.602
You even tried to kidnap and kill someone!

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:46.562
I didn't kidnap her!

00:10:46.562 --> 00:10:49.023
I was just anxious and wanted her
to give me the information.

00:10:49.023 --> 00:10:51.608
Shut up, Qian Xiao An!

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.154
Yi Fu.

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:57.031
He's your uncle after all.

00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:58.949
We can't let him go to jail.

00:10:58.949 --> 00:11:02.328
You can ask Pan Xin Tong to tell the police

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.829
that it was all a misunderstanding.

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:06.207
Are you out of your mind?

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.209
Pan Xin Tong is the victim.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.127
What do you want her to tell the police?

00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:11.712
I didn't mean it that way.

00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:14.423
I don't know how this happened.
I didn't kidnap her.

00:11:14.423 --> 00:11:16.342
You want me to plead with Pan Xin Tong for you?

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:17.635
That's impossible.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:20.720
You deserve to go to jail.

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:28.270
I'm not asking you to plead
with Pan Xin Tong for me.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.691
I just want you to take me
to the hospital to see her.

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:34.235
I'll tell her the rest myself.

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.903
Yi Fu.

00:11:35.903 --> 00:11:38.698
Your uncle isn't an evil person.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:41.506
Do you really want to ruin his life?

00:12:02.012 --> 00:12:03.730
Pan Xin Tong!

00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:06.892
How did you get hurt like this?

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:08.644
Xiao Qi.

00:12:08.644 --> 00:12:11.647
Did you receive the evidence
Xiao Ting Yun exposed about Qian Xiao An?

00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:14.233
You still care about that?

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:17.820
I didn't dare to keep it with me then,
so I sent it to you by courier.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.321
Did you get it?

00:12:19.321 --> 00:12:21.614
Don't worry, I got it.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.460
My goodness. What's going on?

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.069
Have some water.

00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:52.563
I'm begging you.

00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:55.357
Don't go off on your own. It's dangerous.

00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:58.070
You should at least tell me what's going on.

00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:03.491
If someone like Qian Xiao An can be punished,

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:06.076
this is just a minor injury.

00:13:06.076 --> 00:13:07.828
It's nothing.

00:13:07.828 --> 00:13:10.039
You call this a minor injury?

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:12.052
You're already in the hospital.

00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:15.628
Don't worry about
Qian Xiao An taking kickbacks.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.630
Attorney Ren and I will handle it.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.480
You just get some rest, okay?

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.104
I've been adjusting her medication.

00:13:34.104 --> 00:13:36.565
Ms. Fan has accepted the fact
that she's delusional.

00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:39.656
She's willing to take the medication now.

00:13:41.403 --> 00:13:44.615
However, after the report was published,

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:46.992
her fiancé kept coming here.

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:50.287
It is a bit stressful.

00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:52.706
I think...

00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:55.086
- If...
- Let her go.

00:13:57.586 --> 00:14:00.506
I fabricated this medical record.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.216
Why would you do that?

00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:04.518
You saw the report.

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:08.389
Actually, arranging for her
to be admitted was my plan.

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:11.809
As a psychiatrist, you should know
how serious this is.

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:13.604
You could lose your license!

00:14:13.604 --> 00:14:15.237
Gu Hou Ze!

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:20.568
Gu Hou Ze!

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.778
Why would you ruin yourself?

00:14:22.778 --> 00:14:24.613
You're sick, go to hell!

00:14:24.613 --> 00:14:26.965
Why did you get me involved?

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:29.326
Don't worry.

00:14:29.326 --> 00:14:32.037
You won't lose a single license on your wall.

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:34.748
Report it however you want.

00:14:34.748 --> 00:14:36.834
And you won't be shortchanged

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:39.169
on this hospitalization fee.

00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:40.543
You!

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.222
Duo Duo!

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:52.015
Duo Duo!

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.146
Duo Duo!

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:52.612
I can't believe that woman
lied to the whole world.

00:15:53.494 --> 00:15:55.620
And she lied to you, too.

00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:03.086
You should be getting out soon.

00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:07.424
I know.

00:16:07.424 --> 00:16:10.187
Aren't you here to pick me up?

00:16:18.268 --> 00:16:19.353
What?

00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:20.872
I quit.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.024
You quit smoking?

00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:25.540
Why?

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:34.575
Actually, I don't like it when you smoke.

00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:38.498
But I really like watching you
use this lighter.

00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:41.520
It feels like...

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.062
you love me a lot.

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:54.486
Let's start over.

00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:04.294
You should know this.

00:17:08.235 --> 00:17:10.570
It's better if you don't say it.

00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:15.033
I don't love you anymore.

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.248
Say it again.

00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:22.332
I don't love you anymore.

00:17:22.332 --> 00:17:23.792
Say it again.

00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:25.002
I don't love you anymore.

00:17:25.002 --> 00:17:27.275
Say it again.

00:17:33.635 --> 00:17:35.164
I don't love you anymore.

00:17:35.929 --> 00:17:39.503
How could love just disappear like that?

00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:42.477
I don't believe you.

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:47.775
I don't know why either.

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:49.489
The love is just gone.

00:17:51.528 --> 00:17:54.268
Then why do you keep using this lighter?

00:17:57.451 --> 00:18:00.287
It's not that you don't love me.

00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:02.498
You just temporarily fell in love
with Zhou Xiao Qi.

00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:05.124
It has nothing to do with her.

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:09.587
We've been fighting for so many years.

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:13.967
I'm tired.

00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:17.679
I don't want to fight with you.

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.266
I've thought about leaving you, too.

00:18:19.266 --> 00:18:22.535
But I didn't. I didn't do it.

00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:27.022
If I did that,

00:18:27.022 --> 00:18:30.484
I'd have nothing left, so I can't give up.

00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:32.611
I don't want to.

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:35.026
Maybe we both need to learn to accept it.

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:37.933
There's really nothing left.

00:18:49.419 --> 00:18:51.342
Do you hate her?

00:18:54.842 --> 00:18:56.547
Do you hate me?

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:00.455
Do you hate me?

00:19:18.236 --> 00:19:19.613
I'm sorry.

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:25.041
I'm sorry.

00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:46.568
Xin Tong.

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:54.503
It's okay, my mom wants to
see you and apologize.

00:20:03.493 --> 00:20:06.955
Yi Fu's uncle made a mistake.

00:20:06.955 --> 00:20:09.249
He hurt you.

00:20:09.249 --> 00:20:12.044
I sincerely apologize to you on his behalf.

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:14.128
I'm truly sorry.

00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:28.019
Regarding the kickbacks,
he has to face it himself.

00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:31.536
But as for the kidnapping...

00:20:35.442 --> 00:20:38.153
Could you please settle it with him privately?

00:20:38.153 --> 00:20:40.571
Don't report it to the police.

00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:43.993
Mom.

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:45.656
Xin Tong can make her own decisions.

00:20:45.656 --> 00:20:47.495
Don't pressure her.

00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:02.677
For the sake of this family,

00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:06.534
and for the last wish of Yi Fu's father.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.143
I know you may not agree with my actions.

00:21:14.189 --> 00:21:16.014
I just hope...

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:20.821
you can understand a mother's good intentions.

00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:25.450
Please reconsider this matter carefully.

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:41.925
Mom.

00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:45.294
Did you really mean what you just said?

00:21:50.267 --> 00:21:53.929
You and your uncle are my closest family now.

00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:58.082
Your safety and well-being
are what matter most.

00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:03.613
From now on, I won't interfere
with your life anymore.

00:22:03.613 --> 00:22:06.616
Even if you want to marry Pan Xin Tong,

00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:08.659
I have no objections.

00:22:10.954 --> 00:22:12.247
Mom.

00:22:12.247 --> 00:22:16.027
Are you trying to stop
Xin Tong from reporting Uncle?

00:22:18.378 --> 00:22:20.756
Your uncle did such a terrible thing to her.

00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:23.101
I'm truly sorry.

00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:26.011
She didn't call the police right away.

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:28.601
It must be because of you.

00:22:29.723 --> 00:22:32.726
Someone who truly cares about my son,

00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:35.603
a woman my son truly loves.

00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:39.057
What reason do I have to object?

00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:08.522
Xin Tong.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.890
My mom truly accepts you.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.100
It's not for my uncle.

00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:18.438
If you don't want to
forgive him, that's normal.

00:23:18.438 --> 00:23:20.690
He has to be responsible for his mistakes.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.012
These two things are separate.

00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:30.200
Forget it.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.033
I don't want to pursue it.

00:23:34.788 --> 00:23:36.289
I mean it.

00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:37.624
Don't force yourself.

00:23:37.624 --> 00:23:39.834
He's your uncle.

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:43.588
No matter what happens,

00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:45.654
you're still family.

00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:49.052
Besides, the kickback issue

00:23:49.052 --> 00:23:51.123
is enough of a lesson for him.

00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:13.027
My mom finally stopped objecting.

00:24:14.828 --> 00:24:16.521
Xin Tong.

00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:20.040
Let's get married.

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:28.883
Do you really want to get married?

00:24:33.555 --> 00:24:35.807
Of course, I want to get married.

00:24:35.807 --> 00:24:40.020
We can do whatever we want,
and live the life we want.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.049
No one will control us anymore.

00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:07.103
Okay.

00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:19.004
Where's the ring?

00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:24.075
I'm just kidding.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.363
I have a few announcements to make.

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:36.034
First, Shi Weekly used
illegally wiretapped audio

00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:37.619
to create false reports.

00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:40.330
We've decided to sue.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:44.000
Second, the few directors
who covet management rights

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.419
used Chairman Zhou's personal privacy

00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:48.463
to spread false information.

00:25:48.463 --> 00:25:51.216
They incited conflict
between employees and leadership.

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:55.011
We strongly condemn this.

00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:58.974
Thirdly, regarding Hongfa's
Vice President Qian Xiao An

00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:01.268
receiving kickbacks from vendors,

00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:03.353
it has been confirmed to be true.

00:26:03.353 --> 00:26:05.522
From today,

00:26:05.522 --> 00:26:08.942
our company officially terminates
Vice President Qian Xiao An's position.

00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:10.819
As for the follow-up questions,

00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:14.573
we will file a lawsuit
according to legal procedures.

00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:16.140
Thank you, everyone.

00:26:25.493 --> 00:26:29.768
[Gu Hou Ze]

00:26:48.148 --> 00:26:50.983
You'll be discharged today.
Why are you still here?

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:57.153
Can you express mail this letter for me?

00:26:58.366 --> 00:27:01.994
Sure. Hurry up then.
Mr. Wei is waiting for you.

00:27:13.506 --> 00:27:16.490
Ms. Zhou, here's a document for you to sign.

00:27:19.554 --> 00:27:20.930
Have you read it?

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:22.541
Yes, I've confirmed it.

00:27:26.936 --> 00:27:28.980
How are you feeling?

00:27:29.773 --> 00:27:32.192
Much better. Don't worry.

00:27:32.192 --> 00:27:35.445
Are you really going to let Qian Xiao An go?

00:27:35.445 --> 00:27:37.447
Yes.

00:27:37.447 --> 00:27:39.366
Can I?

00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:41.258
It's up to you.

00:27:48.124 --> 00:27:51.335
You're getting married? That's so sudden.

00:27:54.089 --> 00:27:56.799
He proposed to me at the hospital.

00:27:58.468 --> 00:28:00.428
We've been through so much.

00:28:00.428 --> 00:28:03.098
We seem to cherish each other even more, so...

00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:05.016
We're moving a little faster.

00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:06.665
It's not bad.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.646
Marriage affects a person's entire life.

00:28:09.646 --> 00:28:12.593
So, if you don't have any doubts,
just get married.

00:28:16.486 --> 00:28:18.488
- Am I interrupting you two?
- Not at all.

00:28:18.488 --> 00:28:20.156
I just received news.

00:28:20.156 --> 00:28:22.075
Our public acquisition of Chaomai

00:28:22.075 --> 00:28:26.287
has reached 12.5 percent of the shares.

00:28:26.287 --> 00:28:29.082
- We did it!
- That's great.

00:28:29.082 --> 00:28:31.292
Tomorrow, I'll officially report
to the authorities

00:28:31.292 --> 00:28:33.878
and announce our acquisition results online.

00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:35.046
I've been thinking...

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:36.339
If nothing unexpected happens,

00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:39.958
Lin Xi Ming should be talking to you soon.

00:28:41.177 --> 00:28:42.595
Okay.

00:28:42.595 --> 00:28:45.931
Abla, you're amazing!

00:28:55.935 --> 00:28:57.865
- Gu Hou Ze?
- Yes.

00:28:57.865 --> 00:28:59.112
[Mr. Gu Hou Ze]

00:28:59.112 --> 00:29:01.082
Please sign for it in the bottom right corner.

00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:11.979
Besides water, do you want
anything else to eat?

00:29:12.876 --> 00:29:16.004
I'm a little hungry,
but I don't know what to eat.

00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:18.757
You can choose for me. Choose what you like.

00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:20.550
Okay.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.427
Da Wei.

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:25.430
Thank you for always taking care of me.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.530
If it weren't for you,
I would have died long ago.

00:29:29.392 --> 00:29:32.020
If we could have been together earlier,

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.189
we wouldn't have to go through all this.

00:29:34.189 --> 00:29:36.440
So much has happened.

00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:38.860
It's okay.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.042
We have plenty of time.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.591
Wait for me.

00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:54.501
Well...

00:29:54.501 --> 00:29:56.419
Let's buy a few more snacks.

00:29:56.419 --> 00:29:57.774
Okay.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.047
Hou Ze.

00:31:23.047 --> 00:31:29.178
If all goes well, by the time
you receive this letter,

00:31:29.178 --> 00:31:35.482
I should have already
weathered the storm and left you.

00:31:36.797 --> 00:31:39.624
I've done many things to hurt you.

00:31:40.815 --> 00:31:44.032
That's only because I couldn't stop loving you.

00:31:45.778 --> 00:31:47.473
I'm sorry.

00:31:48.364 --> 00:31:50.206
Please forgive me.

00:31:52.493 --> 00:31:57.952
If I could have died here
with you six years ago,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.833
I would have thought life was beautiful.

00:32:02.837 --> 00:32:06.428
These past six years, I've lived them in vain.

00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:11.846
Hearing you say to me, "I don't love you,"

00:32:11.846 --> 00:32:14.390
it's strange.

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:20.730
The first feeling wasn't sadness, but relief.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:22.536
It feels like...

00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:28.071
we've reached the end.

00:32:28.071 --> 00:32:29.617
That's the feeling.

00:32:33.076 --> 00:32:37.121
After meeting Zhou Xiao Qi, I suddenly realized

00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:40.974
that love doesn't have
to be expressed in just one way.

00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:43.409
And I...

00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:47.006
might not be the only one in this world

00:32:47.006 --> 00:32:50.032
who deserves to love you.

00:32:51.761 --> 00:32:57.016
After I leave, I don't want you
to be like your dad.

00:32:57.016 --> 00:33:00.472
Don't live in guilt and pain
for the rest of your life.

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:04.148
After all, this is my own choice.

00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:06.012
It has nothing to do with you.

00:33:07.735 --> 00:33:10.613
Out of all my choices,

00:33:10.613 --> 00:33:12.281
this is the most selfish

00:33:12.281 --> 00:33:14.548
and the most gentle one.

00:33:16.244 --> 00:33:18.934
You said you wanted me to give you freedom.

00:33:19.872 --> 00:33:21.624
This is it.

00:33:21.624 --> 00:33:24.751
This is the last thing I can do for you.

00:33:25.878 --> 00:33:29.452
Just think that I'm going on
a journey to a faraway place.

00:33:30.925 --> 00:33:33.344
This world without any expectations

00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:36.043
is just a dream to me.

00:33:37.098 --> 00:33:40.954
I believe in another world,

00:33:41.728 --> 00:33:46.107
we will both smile when we meet again.

00:33:46.107 --> 00:33:50.955
When that time comes,
everything will be wonderful.

00:33:52.405 --> 00:33:55.950
♫ Broken at a blast ♫

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:58.202
♫ Something good ♫

00:33:58.202 --> 00:34:00.747
♫ Some mistakes ♫

00:34:00.747 --> 00:34:06.018
♫ Blue will come through all at last ♫

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.892
Thanks.

00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:22.935
- This is for you.
- Does it fit?

00:34:22.935 --> 00:34:24.687
Everyone, raise your glasses.

00:34:24.687 --> 00:34:26.481
Thank you for your hard work.

00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:28.274
Today, let's eat and drink to our fill.

00:34:28.274 --> 00:34:30.777
- It's on Mr. Xin.
- You've all worked hard.

00:34:30.777 --> 00:34:32.695
- Cheers!
- Thank you, boss.

00:34:32.695 --> 00:34:34.739
It's my treat today.
Just focus on enjoying the food.

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:36.043
Okay.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.243
This is delicious.

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:42.580
By the way, thank you for your hard work.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:43.831
Cheers.

00:34:43.831 --> 00:34:45.001
Cheers.

00:34:51.547 --> 00:34:54.050
I have a friend who's an editor at Shi Weekly.

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:56.427
He told me that the article
about us having dinner in Taichung

00:34:56.427 --> 00:34:58.554
was your mom's doing.

00:34:58.554 --> 00:35:00.056
Yes.

00:35:00.056 --> 00:35:01.849
I heard about it, too.

00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:05.394
Your mom always interferes
with your relationships?

00:35:05.394 --> 00:35:09.857
I should say, my mom hasn't approved of

00:35:09.857 --> 00:35:11.957
any of my girlfriends.

00:35:13.402 --> 00:35:16.287
And you haven't approved of
any of your mom's arrangements.

00:35:18.491 --> 00:35:20.535
It's fine.

00:35:20.535 --> 00:35:23.070
My dad also arranged many dates for me.

00:35:24.413 --> 00:35:26.249
I've been thinking lately...

00:35:26.249 --> 00:35:28.793
They emphasize being a good match.

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:31.087
If we have the same family background,

00:35:31.087 --> 00:35:33.131
similar values,

00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:35.216
and we're comfortable together,

00:35:35.216 --> 00:35:36.964
what's wrong with that?

00:35:39.762 --> 00:35:41.139
I don't know either.

00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:45.476
I just feel like if I can't be myself.

00:35:45.476 --> 00:35:47.917
It feels like I have no presence.

00:35:51.065 --> 00:35:56.082
What if that person happens
to be someone you like?

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.073
What do you mean?

00:36:07.707 --> 00:36:09.298
I like you.

00:36:26.017 --> 00:36:28.186
It's okay.

00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:30.187
Think about it and let me know.

00:36:45.912 --> 00:36:47.844
Why are you so late?

00:36:49.207 --> 00:36:51.334
The clients loved today's proposal.

00:36:51.334 --> 00:36:54.598
I thought I'd treat everyone
to dinner after work.

00:37:01.135 --> 00:37:02.324
Go take a shower.

00:37:02.324 --> 00:37:04.596
We have to look at wedding dresses tomorrow.

00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:03.465
What's wrong with you today?

00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:18.043
I love you.

00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:23.491
I really love you.

00:39:29.116 --> 00:39:30.284
Hello?

00:39:30.284 --> 00:39:33.801
Hello, Mr. Gu. This is Yixin Nursing Home.

00:39:34.622 --> 00:39:36.457
How can I help you?

00:39:36.457 --> 00:39:38.626
Your father fell down a few days ago.

00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:40.002
He can't stand up now.

00:39:40.002 --> 00:39:43.718
We want to take him
to the hospital, but he refuses.

00:39:44.799 --> 00:39:46.675
So?

00:39:46.675 --> 00:39:49.304
He insists that you come over.

00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:54.480
I see. Thank you.

00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:16.020
Here, our bride is ready.

00:40:20.376 --> 00:40:22.069
It's gorgeous.

00:40:26.882 --> 00:40:28.384
Is this the last one?

00:40:28.384 --> 00:40:30.261
Yes, this is the last one.

00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:32.958
Is there a specific design you want?

00:40:37.977 --> 00:40:40.747
Let me change first. I'll think about it.

00:40:43.816 --> 00:40:45.860
You've tried on the best, Pronovias,

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:49.363
Marchesa, and Ines Di Santo.

00:40:49.363 --> 00:40:51.573
You didn't like any of them?

00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:55.516
Maybe I'm not good enough.

00:40:57.371 --> 00:40:58.497
Mom.

00:40:58.497 --> 00:40:59.874
Don't you have a meeting today?

00:40:59.874 --> 00:41:01.000
You should get back to work.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.924
I'll stay with Xin Tong to try on dresses.

00:41:06.338 --> 00:41:07.923
We have to try the food tomorrow.

00:41:07.923 --> 00:41:09.216
You two should decide
on the wedding dress soon.

00:41:09.216 --> 00:41:11.760
You better decide soon.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.020
Okay.

00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:15.934
I'll walk my mom to the car.

00:41:15.934 --> 00:41:17.975
Okay.

00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:19.762
Mom, over here.

00:41:22.146 --> 00:41:24.148
Hello. We'll adjust it after you change.

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:25.544
Thank you.

00:41:43.876 --> 00:41:45.127
Are you okay?

00:41:45.127 --> 00:41:47.880
You didn't like any of them?

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.633
I don't know. They're...

00:41:50.633 --> 00:41:53.052
They're okay.

00:41:53.052 --> 00:41:54.720
You look beautiful in all of them.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:58.455
I can't wait to get married and bring you home.

00:41:59.558 --> 00:42:01.052
Get some rest.

00:42:05.814 --> 00:42:07.943
When are we moving back home?

00:42:08.734 --> 00:42:10.653
Why do we have to move back?

00:42:10.653 --> 00:42:12.196
Excuse me.

00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:13.531
Thank you.

00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:14.918
Thank you.

00:42:15.783 --> 00:42:17.426
Thank you.

00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:22.501
Once we're married, don't we have to move back?

00:42:23.582 --> 00:42:27.670
Is this your mom's idea or yours?

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:29.338
Your place is rented.

00:42:29.338 --> 00:42:30.381
It's smaller.

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.383
And we can save money by moving back.

00:42:32.383 --> 00:42:34.169
It's more comfortable.

00:42:36.512 --> 00:42:37.888
You're marrying me.

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:40.117
I have to give you a better life.

00:42:48.607 --> 00:42:50.501
Let me think about it.

00:43:05.124 --> 00:43:07.334
I'm so full.

00:43:07.334 --> 00:43:09.920
I didn't know tasting food would be so tiring.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.381
It's because your mom is so demanding.

00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:14.341
She complains that the ingredients
aren't high-end.

00:43:14.341 --> 00:43:16.802
Then she complains that
the food isn't festive enough.

00:43:16.802 --> 00:43:18.429
It's giving me a headache.

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:22.474
That's because my mom
wants the banquet to be perfect.

00:43:22.474 --> 00:43:24.578
So, let my mom decide the menu.

00:43:25.853 --> 00:43:28.575
Everything's decided by your mom.

00:43:30.024 --> 00:43:31.442
I'm her only son.

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:32.985
It's not easy for her to get married.

00:43:32.985 --> 00:43:34.361
We should cooperate more.

00:43:34.361 --> 00:43:36.101
Let's make her happy.

00:43:40.159 --> 00:43:42.620
I am cooperating, okay?

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.998
From the V.I.P list to the venue,

00:43:45.998 --> 00:43:48.441
your mom has the final say.

00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:51.378
Let's be patient.

00:43:51.378 --> 00:43:54.714
Everything will be fine
once the banquet is over.

00:43:57.593 --> 00:43:59.564
As if.

00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:14.435
I've made up my mind.

00:44:15.235 --> 00:44:17.446
I'm going to find that wedding dress.

00:44:17.446 --> 00:44:18.947
Which wedding dress?

00:44:18.947 --> 00:44:22.492
This one. I want to get married in it.

00:44:26.705 --> 00:44:28.234
Are you serious?

00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:31.794
There are so many branded
wedding dresses for you.

00:44:31.794 --> 00:44:33.587
Are you sure you want to wear this?

00:44:33.587 --> 00:44:36.215
Everything is decided by your mom.

00:44:36.215 --> 00:44:39.276
Let me decide on this.

00:44:40.719 --> 00:44:41.970
Okay.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:44.848
If you can find it, sure.

00:44:44.848 --> 00:44:46.016
Okay.

00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:47.533
Okay.

00:44:57.736 --> 00:45:01.281
There's something I want to talk to you about.

00:45:01.281 --> 00:45:02.991
It's not about your mom again, is it?

00:45:02.991 --> 00:45:04.243
No.

00:45:04.243 --> 00:45:08.372
I was thinking, after we get married,

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:10.165
you should quit your job.

00:45:10.165 --> 00:45:12.111
Let's work at Snobis together.

00:45:13.085 --> 00:45:15.295
Why?

00:45:15.295 --> 00:45:16.572
We have our own company.

00:45:16.572 --> 00:45:18.713
Why work for someone else?

00:45:20.008 --> 00:45:22.928
We're a married couple,
so we should work together.

00:45:22.928 --> 00:45:25.639
We can make Snobis the best in the industry.

00:45:25.639 --> 00:45:28.392
That should make my mom happy.

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:29.768
Don't worry.

00:45:29.768 --> 00:45:31.520
Whether it's salary or position,

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.980
it'll be better than at Hongfa.

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:37.002
Xin Yi Fu.

00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:44.907
I'm marrying you, not selling myself to you.

00:45:45.993 --> 00:45:47.661
What do you mean?

00:45:47.661 --> 00:45:50.080
You said you wanted to move back home.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.708
I don't want to, but I can consider it.

00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:54.752
Now you're even interfering with my work.

00:45:54.752 --> 00:45:56.253
What's next?

00:45:56.253 --> 00:45:59.297
Are you and your mom
going to control my entire life?

00:46:00.841 --> 00:46:02.472
No.

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:05.272
Why are you saying it like that?

00:46:06.722 --> 00:46:11.093
How about we discuss it again?

00:46:12.144 --> 00:46:13.896
There's nothing to discuss.

00:46:13.896 --> 00:46:17.608
I like my current job. I'm not quitting.

00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:19.482
I'm going to the restroom.
