00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.759
Your Highness

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.439
Wu Mao said the Wujia Village chief
is a tough nut.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.960
He keeps opposing us
again and again.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.560
If that Shi Feifan kid is found by him,

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.239
he'll definitely tell the truth.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.879
If that doesn't work,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.799
find a way to shut them all up.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.040
You understand all my orders, right?

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.319
Understood.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.159
How could he be here?

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.319
No wonder she didn't eat it herself.

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:10.159
Turns out it was for the chief.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.080
We really do need food.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.319
Thank you, everyone.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.159
This poor child...

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:26.840
Her father was beaten to death.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400
Her mother was taken away.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.800
Suffered that damn Your Highness's abuse.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.199
Out of shame and anger,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.400
she ran into a wall.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.120
This child is nine years old.

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:45.840
She still won't speak.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.639
In this family,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.479
just to have something to eat,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.280
they've sold everything they could.

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.120
Stop for a moment.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.199
We're mainly here to ask you something.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.479
I...

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:13.719
I don't know anything.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.159
Wu Mao.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.039
He's at the chief's house.

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.000
Why are you alone?

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.759
I walk fast.

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.919
Lord Nan said,

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:34.360
stir things up first.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.680
The main force will arrive soon.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.639
You old man...

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:54.000
We gave you steamed buns.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.400
How can you talk like that?

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:56.639
Don't talk about the chief like that.

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.000
Stay out of grown-ups' business.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.879
Take her back.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.039
Safe and sound.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.360
Young Duke.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.759
This is the Imperial Sword
bestowed by His Majesty.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:30.800
Chief, you can trust us now, right?

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.759
My name is Shi Feifan.

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.000
My father is Duke of Nan, Shi Mengze.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.399
He leads the Shi Family Army,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.279
defending our country as Duke of Nan.

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:48.800
Chief.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.600
Please, get up, get up.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.720
There's finally hope.

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.360
Don't kneel, please stand up.

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.439
Quick, quick, please rise.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.240
There's hope now.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.160
I want to know the truth.

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:06.480
Over there.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:07.879
Folks, hurry up.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.480
Safe and sound.

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:14.199
I understand.

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:19.680
Everyone, everyone!

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:23.560
Folks, it's him!

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.319
He's here to harm us.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:27.279
Grab him!

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.639
Everyone, everyone!

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.959
He's an important official from the capital.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.720
He's here to save us from disaster.

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:37.000
Chief, are you out of your mind?

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:38.839
Save us from disaster?

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.720
An important official?

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:42.279
What big official comes to a place like this?

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:43.759
If you ask me,

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.439
he just wants to win our trust

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.399
so he can steal our seed grain.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.319
If he steals our seed grain,

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:51.360
what will we eat?

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.800
How will we survive?

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.519
Right?

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:54.319
That's right.

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:55.079
Exactly.

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.720
Catch him!

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:56.759
Grab him!

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:58.319
You people are clueless!

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.399
We came with the emperor's decree.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.680
What?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.519
The imperial decree?

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.600
He's just making it up.

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.319
Then show us the decree!

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.639
Well, Young Duke...

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.720
Can't show it, can you?

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.000
He's a fraud!

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.000
Fraud!

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.279
Spy!

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:20.360
Spy, you!

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.079
Fraud! Fraud!

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.800
You all...

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:25.759
Wu Mao, right?

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.079
I think you're the real problem.

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:31.439
Speak up.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.319
Who's behind you?

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.040
It's him!

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.959
I've seen him several times

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.600
sneaking around for seed grain.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.079
He was just with a constable.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.839
Wu Mao, you...

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.759
No wonder the constable shows up
whenever we collect grain.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.120
So you're the real spy!

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:51.199
Wu Mao, how dare you trick us!

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:52.199
Let me tell you,

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.720
Lord Nan will be here soon.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.360
He'll have you all arrested.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.120
The county jail is stricter than
the Imperial Prison.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.519
You'll all be begging me then.

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:04.199
Wu Mao, how could you side with bandits?

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.879
You old fool!

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:10.439
Lord Nan is our county's magistrate.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.600
He has support in the capital too.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.160
If you know what's good for you,

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:15.959
arrest them now.

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:18.639
Then I might plead for you.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.759
Folks, grab him!

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.040
Yes, grab him! Grab him!

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.120
Beat him! Beat him!

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.240
Hit!

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.920
Beat him! Beat him!

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:34.800
Go!

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.519
Stay close.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.480
Young Duke, wake up!

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.040
Young Duke, sir, be careful—it's a trap!

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.639
Young Duke!

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.319
Young Duke!

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.600
Wake up, Young Duke!

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.800
Kneel before me!

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.480
Kneel!

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:24.959
Come here.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.800
Let them go.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:33.759
Let them go.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:34.759
Fine.

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:36.200
But...

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.679
You have to hand over the Gatling.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.799
Tell me, where did you hide it?

00:08:57.799 --> 00:09:01.200
I heard this weapon is powerful.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.519
I'd like to try it myself.

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:09.919
What are you planning?

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:32.519
Your Highness Liang Qing made
such a big scene

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.039
just for this thing?

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:37.600
This isn't much, really.

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:39.600
It's just a hunk of iron
that hurts your hand.

00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:50.120
I advise you to let us go.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.039
Or you'll regret it.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.440
The emperor is far away.

00:09:57.759 --> 00:09:58.679
Do you believe it?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.519
I can have them killed one by one
right in front of you.

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:03.759
Then chop you up and feed you to the dogs.

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:04.519
You—

00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:06.240
Our Young Duke

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:08.519
is here by imperial decree.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.399
Don't do anything reckless.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.559
You are the chicken—

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:16.360
I am—

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:17.480
I—I—I...

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.039
Sir,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.559
You are the fish, I am the knife.

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.039
Go.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.440
Go.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.240
Since I'm the knife,

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:28.919
I can cut you down.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.120
You—You...

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.519
Our Duke of Nan won't let you off.

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:38.639
I'll burn Wujia Village to the ground.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.639
So no one can testify against me.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.600
What can you do to us?

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:43.080
You—

00:10:44.559 --> 00:10:45.480
On your turf,

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:47.360
of course we follow your lead.

00:10:48.799 --> 00:10:50.600
Since you know your place,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.480
I'll make it quick for you later.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.639
Get them!

00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:55.679
I'm the Imperial Commissioner.

00:10:56.759 --> 00:10:57.679
Don't you think

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.600
I'm missing something?

00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:21.559
Tell me, where is the Imperial Sword?

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:24.320
The Imperial Sword is somewhere safe.

00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:26.919
If you want to know, let them go.

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:29.519
You—You—You...

00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:30.879
Tell me right now!

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.840
Or I'll kill you right now.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.759
The Imperial Sword isn't in Wujia Village.

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:39.279
Wu Mao!

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:41.480
Hurry, hurry!

00:11:41.879 --> 00:11:42.320
Sir!

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.600
I saw someone take the sword away.

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:45.360
What?

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:46.519
Really.

00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:48.799
My men are already heading to the capital.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.879
If I die in Mou County,

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.879
you won't escape responsibility.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.840
I'm the only son of the Duke of Nan.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.039
And a favorite of the emperor.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:00.879
Liang Qing—

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.240
is just a neglected Your Highness.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:04.960
Lord Nan,

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.000
we should think long-term.

00:12:17.039 --> 00:12:18.080
So tell me,

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.039
what can I get out of this?

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.240
A wise man adapts to the times.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.879
Talents like Lord Nan

00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:27.879
in the Shi Family Army

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.480
could easily be a general.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:32.919
What do you think?

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.679
General...

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:45.559
Nan Batian, what are you up to?

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.639
What do you think?

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:52.399
What do you want?

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.039
You—

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.039
Of course, I'm untying you, sir.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:02.639
Sir,

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.679
Let's keep our agreement.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.159
Lord Nan saved my life.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.480
I will keep my word.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.320
But—

00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:16.360
Sir, you tell me—

00:13:18.039 --> 00:13:19.360
With Liang Qing here,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.039
I can't finish the emperor's task.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.000
I can't get Lord Nan a post.

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:30.519
I might not even survive to return.

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:32.879
Come.

00:13:36.759 --> 00:13:39.320
Sir, this place is too rough.

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:41.679
Let's go to my office instead.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.480
We can discuss things in detail.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.200
Sir, please, please.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.000
Please.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.320
Slow down, slow down.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.159
Slow down.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.159
Sir, slow down.

00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:00.240
Stop!

00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:02.480
Speak.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.960
Why are you following us?

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:13.200
You can see

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:14.720
I mean no harm.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.960
I just want to know

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.039
the truth behind my family's massacre.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.480
Don't worry, Village Chief.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.080
I'll deliver it to Lord Shi.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.480
Come.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.120
Carry it.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.600
Be careful on the road.

00:14:58.159 --> 00:14:59.919
Please take care of Ying'er, Chief.

00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:07.120
Go back.

00:15:16.759 --> 00:15:17.720
Safe travels.

00:15:22.559 --> 00:15:24.240
Chief, will there be any trouble?

00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:28.799
Our words alone aren't enough.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.799
They'll blame the big families.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.519
In the end, only the magistrate

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:34.000
will be charged with mismanagement.

00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:39.639
Instead of waiting for the enemy to slip up,

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.519
we should strike first.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.000
Turn their trick against them.
