WEBVTT

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:06.911
Gentle-hearted gay man Genichi Hatano

00:00:06.978 --> 00:00:07.812
and his crush,

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:10.949
Saku Sakuta, end up living
in the same apartment.

00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:12.283
The contract between Hotaru,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.419
"Parent-Child Contract",
now has Saku's name too.

00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:18.356
Meanwhile, Tomoe, while still on the run,
visits Inokashira…

00:00:18.423 --> 00:00:20.158
I want you to give these to Hotaru.

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:22.127
…and runs into her ex-husband who's after

00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:23.228
the 30 million yen.

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:24.462
Koito…

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.431
I liked him so much back in middle school,

00:00:26.498 --> 00:00:28.199
but I said things like,
"Don't touch me, gay!"

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.168
As memories of first love resurface,

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:31.736
a love story begins to bloom!

00:00:31.803 --> 00:00:34.072
Like this.

00:00:36.274 --> 00:00:39.577
You know, maybe I should go see him.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:42.514
Koito.

00:00:43.348 --> 00:00:45.383
Are you seriously…

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.819
saying that in this situation?

00:00:48.853 --> 00:00:50.822
Sorry, I was just joking.

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:52.657
No way he’s the Koito I know.

00:00:53.358 --> 00:00:55.393
-Is that right?
-Yes.

00:00:56.127 --> 00:00:58.263
Well then, good night.

00:00:59.264 --> 00:01:00.265
Um…

00:01:00.765 --> 00:01:01.733
Just a little longer.

00:01:02.534 --> 00:01:04.102
Don’t get ahead of yourself!

00:01:04.169 --> 00:01:06.604
You’re the one who grabbed my hand first.

00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:11.576
-Hey!
-Come on.

00:01:11.643 --> 00:01:13.011
Please let go of my hand.

00:01:14.078 --> 00:01:15.246
Come on!

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:22.020
Hm?

00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:25.390
SUGIMORI ZOOLOGICAL & BOTANICAL PARK

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.861
I wanna etch this feeling into my body!

00:01:29.928 --> 00:01:31.496
What for?

00:01:31.563 --> 00:01:33.498
Because I like you, Sakuta.

00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:35.200
I know that already!

00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:38.603
Ouch!

00:01:39.137 --> 00:01:39.971
Hey…

00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:42.240
-You fell?
-Are you okay?

00:01:42.307 --> 00:01:44.909
-That scared me.
-You alright?

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.244
Yeah.

00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:48.680
Oh dear! You fell, Hotaru?

00:01:48.746 --> 00:01:50.415
The stairs just kinda gave way.

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:52.483
I'm really sorry!

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.718
I'm really fine!

00:01:57.422 --> 00:02:00.358
I guess the stairs are getting old too,
after 60 years.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.628
This apartment is turning 60 years old.

00:02:04.162 --> 00:02:06.197
It was built the year I was born.

00:02:06.264 --> 00:02:07.732
So, you're also the same age?

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.434
-Yeah.
-Sixty years, huh?

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.868
What should we do?

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:11.769
What?

00:02:11.836 --> 00:02:13.371
It's dangerous, so you can’t use them.

00:02:13.938 --> 00:02:15.039
Wanna stay over at my place?

00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:17.976
-Or your dad’s place.
-That's even worse.

00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:22.680
-Sakuta.
-Yes?

00:02:22.747 --> 00:02:24.182
I’m only doing this for Hotaru.

00:02:24.716 --> 00:02:25.783
Sorry to trouble you.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.720
-I'm really sorry about this.
-Whoa.

00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:30.588
Take this as my apology.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.124
Are you sure? That's a lot.

00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:34.826
Share them with everyone, okay?

00:02:36.194 --> 00:02:38.896
Mr. Hatano said he's staying
over at Mr. Sakuta's place.

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.035
-They said they wanna be here.
-Then, be nice to them, okay?

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.505
Breakfast is over here.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:52.677
Snacks are right here.

00:02:52.744 --> 00:02:53.611
Snacks, got it.

00:02:54.112 --> 00:02:55.980
The dogs like this.

00:02:56.714 --> 00:02:58.149
NIKOMADO

00:02:58.216 --> 00:03:00.451
Don't give them snacks before their meal.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.521
YUTARO KOITO

00:03:03.588 --> 00:03:04.622
Koito?

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.894
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:11.796
Please bring your own futon.

00:03:12.363 --> 00:03:13.665
-Okay.
-Good night.

00:03:13.731 --> 00:03:14.565
Good night.

00:03:19.037 --> 00:03:20.038
-Excuse me.
-Huh?

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.640
-This.
-Oh.

00:03:22.707 --> 00:03:25.076
We sell that at our park. You bought one?

00:03:27.178 --> 00:03:28.313
Never mind.

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:29.280
Good night.

00:03:30.548 --> 00:03:31.416
You too.

00:03:36.454 --> 00:03:39.190
It’s a batting center,
not a napping center.

00:03:40.858 --> 00:03:42.827
Quit following me already.

00:03:42.894 --> 00:03:45.463
Maybe I’ll take a swing
for old times’ sake.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.831
-You’ll hurt yourself.
-Whack!

00:03:46.898 --> 00:03:49.033
Watching and actually batting
are totally different.

00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:51.602
Hey! What’s your problem?

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:52.570
Cash is inside it, no?

00:03:52.637 --> 00:03:53.705
Huh?

00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:55.573
Stop it already!

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.842
This kinda feels like a school trip.
Fun, huh?

00:03:58.676 --> 00:04:00.578
Wanna talk about love or something?

00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:02.013
Just go to sleep already.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.088
You know what? Actually, let’s talk.

00:04:10.154 --> 00:04:11.556
About love?

00:04:11.622 --> 00:04:13.057
It feels weird to keep quiet about it.

00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:15.193
About what?

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.099
Is Koito's first name Yutaro?

00:04:21.165 --> 00:04:23.568
Yes. Wait, did I ever tell you?

00:04:24.202 --> 00:04:25.203
Have a look at this.

00:04:25.803 --> 00:04:27.672
YUTARO KOITO

00:04:31.075 --> 00:04:31.909
No way!

00:04:31.976 --> 00:04:34.946
This is Hotaru's. I brought it out
without permission.

00:04:35.012 --> 00:04:38.182
Looks like he works
for an NPO called "Nikomado"

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:39.484
in Kabukicho.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.418
Is that so?

00:04:41.285 --> 00:04:42.487
Is that him?

00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:45.757
Yes. That's Koito.

00:04:45.823 --> 00:04:47.859
Are you going to see him?

00:04:47.925 --> 00:04:49.594
I want to give him a proper apology.

00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:51.496
-Right.
-But

00:04:51.562 --> 00:04:53.231
he probably never wants to see me again.

00:04:53.798 --> 00:04:55.266
You don’t know that.

00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:57.568
Remember what I told you before?

00:04:57.635 --> 00:04:59.237
I didn't want people to know I’m gay,

00:04:59.303 --> 00:05:01.739
so I shoved Koito away

00:05:02.306 --> 00:05:04.375
and even said he was disgusting.

00:05:04.442 --> 00:05:06.411
And saying sorry now?

00:05:06.477 --> 00:05:08.913
That would only make me feel better.
It feels presumptuous.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.281
Deciding how someone else feels

00:05:10.348 --> 00:05:12.717
is just as presumptuous, though.

00:05:13.985 --> 00:05:15.453
You think I should go see him?

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.821
That’s not for me to decide!

00:05:16.888 --> 00:05:18.289
You're right.

00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:21.626
I’m going to sleep.

00:05:24.295 --> 00:05:25.196
Sakuta.

00:05:27.198 --> 00:05:29.033
What’ll you do when this place is gone?

00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:32.804
-What do you mean?
-Buying a house wouldn’t be bad, yes?

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.472
You're still going on about that?

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:35.973
Because I like you, Sakuta.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.443
Yeah, I heard that already.

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:40.745
It’s been a long time
since I’ve felt this way.

00:05:40.812 --> 00:05:42.713
I can’t really tell

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.449
what you’re thinking, Sakuta.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.585
Neither can I.

00:05:48.453 --> 00:05:49.554
Not right now.

00:05:50.254 --> 00:05:52.457
Does that mean maybe someday you will?

00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:56.327
When?

00:05:57.361 --> 00:05:58.396
When will that time come?

00:05:58.463 --> 00:05:59.697
Good night!

00:06:41.906 --> 00:06:43.107
Ow!

00:06:43.174 --> 00:06:45.376
Hard as a rock. Ow…

00:06:45.443 --> 00:06:46.344
NAKAYOSHI PLAZA

00:06:55.052 --> 00:06:55.953
What’s going on?

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.456
For the goat, Koharu’s tenth birthday,

00:06:58.523 --> 00:07:00.725
I thought we’d make
a new info board along with it.

00:07:00.791 --> 00:07:03.027
I asked Fujisawa to handle it.

00:07:03.094 --> 00:07:04.295
What do you think?

00:07:04.362 --> 00:07:05.997
-Let me see.
-Sure.

00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:12.169
Whoa, full-on presbyopia.

00:07:13.004 --> 00:07:14.038
I'm not proud of it.

00:07:14.105 --> 00:07:15.439
Read it for him, Fujisawa.

00:07:15.506 --> 00:07:16.407
Okay.

00:07:17.508 --> 00:07:18.809
"A goat’s tenth birthday

00:07:18.876 --> 00:07:20.878
is like being 71 in human years.

00:07:20.945 --> 00:07:22.947
I used to visit often
when I was little, but--"

00:07:23.014 --> 00:07:24.582
-Really?
-Yes.

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:26.851
Back in school, the kids
messed with my desk and chair.

00:07:26.918 --> 00:07:28.853
They said, "You don’t have a place here."

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.188
So, there was a period
I didn’t go to school.

00:07:31.923 --> 00:07:34.992
Here, though,
there are benches everywhere,

00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:37.762
so I thought maybe
it’s okay for me to be here.

00:07:37.828 --> 00:07:39.664
Moving on. "This goat, Koharu,

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.433
would headbutt me whenever it saw me,
so I never got along with it.

00:07:43.334 --> 00:07:45.303
But after working here,

00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:48.205
I learned that for goats,
headbutting is their form of greeting.

00:07:48.272 --> 00:07:49.307
I realized that

00:07:49.373 --> 00:07:51.909
all those years,
he’d been greeting me every time I came.

00:07:51.976 --> 00:07:53.077
It warmed my heart.

00:07:53.144 --> 00:07:55.913
Happy birthday.
Hope you live a long life."

00:07:57.548 --> 00:07:59.183
-Wonderful!
-It's well-written!

00:08:04.155 --> 00:08:05.856
-Where's the money?
-I don't have it.

00:08:05.923 --> 00:08:07.758
Is it with Hotaru then, after all?

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.595
I didn’t embezzle anything.

00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:13.864
That's a lie, no? It's gotta be!

00:08:14.498 --> 00:08:15.666
How do you know?

00:08:16.567 --> 00:08:18.803
I won’t tell the police, okay?
Let’s split it.

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:20.838
Why are you so desperate for cash anyway?

00:08:20.905 --> 00:08:22.406
Doesn't really matter to you, right?

00:08:23.007 --> 00:08:24.475
You got divorced again, right?

00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:27.244
And you got fired from your job too?

00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:29.880
How do you know?

00:08:30.748 --> 00:08:32.183
Thank you for waiting.

00:08:35.353 --> 00:08:37.121
-Is that all for you?
-Yes.

00:08:37.188 --> 00:08:38.022
Please enjoy.

00:08:38.623 --> 00:08:41.158
What’s with that miserable meal?

00:08:41.225 --> 00:08:42.793
Hey, stop that!

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.029
That’s bad manners. Come on!

00:08:45.096 --> 00:08:46.764
You sound like me.

00:08:47.898 --> 00:08:50.201
-As if!
-Looks good.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.241
You came?

00:08:58.175 --> 00:09:00.244
Yes. My first time in a while.

00:09:01.012 --> 00:09:02.880
I used to come here every day.

00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:05.650
-Really?
-When I was in elementary school,

00:09:06.183 --> 00:09:07.385
I told my mom

00:09:07.451 --> 00:09:09.353
that I think I like petting guinea pigs,

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.589
so she brought me here every day.

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:14.325
I thought it was a bit much,
but I still petted them every day.

00:09:14.392 --> 00:09:15.760
She really cared for you.

00:09:15.826 --> 00:09:17.028
I don’t know.

00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:18.863
She never came back.

00:09:24.035 --> 00:09:24.869
By the way,

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.140
did you get some tutoring from Koinobori?

00:09:29.206 --> 00:09:31.442
He was my classmate from middle school.

00:09:32.043 --> 00:09:34.845
-Really?
-I’m about to finish work.

00:09:34.912 --> 00:09:36.881
If you don't mind,
could you bring me to him?

00:09:36.947 --> 00:09:37.782
YUTARO KOITO

00:09:43.054 --> 00:09:44.355
Yes, this is Sakuta speaking.

00:09:45.756 --> 00:09:48.192
Uh-huh. What?

00:09:48.259 --> 00:09:50.995
SUGIMORI ZOOLOGICAL & BOTANICAL PARK

00:09:56.167 --> 00:09:57.435
Enough already.

00:10:00.071 --> 00:10:01.872
Is the money hidden here by any chance?

00:10:03.808 --> 00:10:05.509
Of course not.

00:10:06.844 --> 00:10:08.112
Then why are you here?

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.614
Just because.

00:10:11.482 --> 00:10:13.751
It’s where I used
to bring Hotaru every day.

00:10:14.952 --> 00:10:17.655
Since her dad wasn’t around,
I felt like I had to do my best.

00:10:18.522 --> 00:10:20.958
Hotaru is asking a guy
living in the same apartment as her

00:10:21.025 --> 00:10:22.927
to pretend to be her dad.
Did you know that?

00:10:24.862 --> 00:10:26.797
-What?
-And he's gay.

00:10:31.102 --> 00:10:32.203
Wow.

00:10:32.937 --> 00:10:34.672
Isn't she impressive?

00:10:35.206 --> 00:10:37.875
This is not the time to be proud of her.
Are you fine with that?

00:10:39.643 --> 00:10:41.312
I’m glad it wasn’t you.

00:10:43.247 --> 00:10:44.615
Why did you marry me then?

00:10:46.851 --> 00:10:48.119
Huh?

00:10:51.956 --> 00:10:54.158
When work was tough,

00:10:54.792 --> 00:10:56.026
you’d take me

00:10:56.093 --> 00:10:58.129
to see the sea at night.

00:10:58.796 --> 00:10:59.663
I said

00:11:00.231 --> 00:11:02.099
it was pitch dark
and I couldn't see a thing.

00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:05.002
You replied that it was fine, and that we
could just look at the dark sea

00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:06.704
and laugh about how dark it was.

00:11:08.539 --> 00:11:10.674
It was at that moment
I thought of marrying you.

00:11:12.176 --> 00:11:14.378
I thought we could laugh
through anything together.

00:11:15.846 --> 00:11:18.182
Why did you divorce someone
like that then?

00:11:19.383 --> 00:11:20.785
Because you said the same thing.

00:11:21.552 --> 00:11:23.487
When Hotaru was born
and things were tough,

00:11:24.321 --> 00:11:25.623
you said, "let’s go see the sea."

00:11:25.689 --> 00:11:26.557
And I was like,

00:11:27.091 --> 00:11:29.527
"What's this dude thinking?"

00:11:31.328 --> 00:11:33.864
I realized you hadn't changed at all.

00:11:33.931 --> 00:11:36.567
You’re not someone I can grow
and change together with.

00:11:37.868 --> 00:11:39.370
I can change!

00:11:40.938 --> 00:11:43.507
You couldn't, and that's why
your remarriage failed.

00:11:44.108 --> 00:11:46.177
Don’t start lecturing me, you criminal!

00:11:46.243 --> 00:11:48.746
I’m just stating the facts.

00:11:49.446 --> 00:11:51.715
Don't forget you walked out on Hotaru too!

00:11:54.151 --> 00:11:55.553
Ouch, that hurts!

00:11:57.555 --> 00:11:58.789
Hey!

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.727
What's this?

00:12:04.662 --> 00:12:05.763
Huh?

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.398
Hey! Is everything alri--

00:12:07.464 --> 00:12:08.332
NO LONGER HUMAN

00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:09.400
Ah!

00:12:12.236 --> 00:12:13.771
May I have more of this?

00:12:13.838 --> 00:12:15.472
Oh, okay.

00:12:19.677 --> 00:12:21.912
Please leave after you're done
with your drink.

00:12:21.979 --> 00:12:22.880
Yeah, will do.

00:12:22.947 --> 00:12:24.682
What are you going to do about this?

00:12:24.748 --> 00:12:27.952
We’ll have to find someone to take it in.

00:12:28.686 --> 00:12:29.587
Let's open your cage.

00:12:31.355 --> 00:12:32.289
There.

00:12:33.257 --> 00:12:34.191
How cute!

00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:41.699
Sorry, I'm late.

00:12:41.765 --> 00:12:44.568
You didn’t really have to come.

00:12:44.635 --> 00:12:46.904
Then why did you bother calling?

00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:49.340
I thought I should let you know,

00:12:49.406 --> 00:12:50.641
just in case.

00:12:50.708 --> 00:12:51.675
Anyway,

00:12:51.742 --> 00:12:54.144
you might go off the rails
like you did with me,

00:12:54.211 --> 00:12:56.347
and start saying nonsense
like buying a house

00:12:56.413 --> 00:12:58.449
and cause trouble, so I was just worried.

00:12:58.515 --> 00:13:00.651
I’d only ever tell you
that kind of thing, Sakuta.

00:13:01.452 --> 00:13:02.419
Are we going or not?

00:13:02.486 --> 00:13:03.988
-It's this way.
-Okay.

00:13:04.054 --> 00:13:05.890
INTERNET AND COMICS

00:13:05.956 --> 00:13:07.892
He should be here…

00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.960
I’m getting nervous somehow.

00:13:10.027 --> 00:13:11.161
I need a bathroom break.

00:13:13.364 --> 00:13:14.198
Sorry.

00:13:15.432 --> 00:13:16.634
Hello!

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.668
Koinobori.

00:13:18.168 --> 00:13:19.870
What's the matter? Did you bring guests?

00:13:19.937 --> 00:13:20.771
Um…

00:13:21.505 --> 00:13:22.439
I'm Hatano.

00:13:22.506 --> 00:13:23.474
Pardon?

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.441
Uh, you know…

00:13:25.175 --> 00:13:26.911
-I'm Gen.
-Gen…

00:13:30.481 --> 00:13:31.649
You're that Gen?

00:13:32.549 --> 00:13:33.884
It's been a while.

00:13:36.153 --> 00:13:37.688
This is my dad.

00:13:37.755 --> 00:13:39.256
The person over here is my teacher.

00:13:41.892 --> 00:13:42.826
Right…

00:13:43.494 --> 00:13:44.628
So?

00:13:45.429 --> 00:13:46.697
Well… Uh,

00:13:47.264 --> 00:13:49.166
I just happened to be nearby…

00:13:49.867 --> 00:13:50.801
and had some time.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.338
If that's the case…

00:13:55.005 --> 00:13:56.073
Hm?

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.409
We are distributing free meals.

00:14:01.912 --> 00:14:03.314
It's hot.

00:14:04.515 --> 00:14:06.917
Why don’t you go help him out over there?

00:14:06.984 --> 00:14:07.952
What?

00:14:08.018 --> 00:14:09.720
Hotaru and I are fine here.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.388
-Don't you think so?
-Huh?

00:14:12.222 --> 00:14:13.057
Yes.

00:14:16.694 --> 00:14:18.662
Remember what you are here for today.

00:14:20.564 --> 00:14:22.466
I’m going to give him a proper apology.

00:14:24.535 --> 00:14:26.136
This is really tough work, huh?

00:14:26.737 --> 00:14:28.973
Yeah, it’s not easy.

00:14:29.039 --> 00:14:29.974
But I enjoy it.

00:14:31.375 --> 00:14:32.309
Doing this for a while?

00:14:32.376 --> 00:14:34.979
I had a job back home for a bit, but…

00:14:36.413 --> 00:14:37.982
I just couldn’t see myself

00:14:38.048 --> 00:14:40.284
-living there long-term.
-What?

00:14:40.351 --> 00:14:43.387
If I stayed there, I felt like I'll lose
my sense of identity.

00:14:43.454 --> 00:14:44.989
I thought that was bad,

00:14:46.023 --> 00:14:47.958
so I came to Tokyo on impulse

00:14:48.025 --> 00:14:50.561
and worked in a bar
in 2-chōme for a while.

00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:53.731
I see.

00:14:54.798 --> 00:14:56.700
I’m gay.

00:14:58.202 --> 00:15:00.104
I hope you're okay with it.

00:15:03.674 --> 00:15:06.043
-I'm gay too.
-What?

00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:09.146
Uh, Sakuta…

00:15:09.747 --> 00:15:11.882
He's Hotaru's teacher, right?

00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:14.618
He's the person I like.

00:15:15.886 --> 00:15:18.922
So, I guess you're co-parenting
Hotaru together?

00:15:18.989 --> 00:15:21.725
Oh, no. We’re not dating to begin with.

00:15:21.792 --> 00:15:23.193
Aw.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.828
I’m actually doing

00:15:24.895 --> 00:15:27.264
foster parent training
with my partner too.

00:15:27.331 --> 00:15:29.700
Wait, fostering kids with your partner?

00:15:30.367 --> 00:15:33.003
Yeah, that became possible
recently. And so…

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:36.540
-You're jealous?
-Yes, I’m jealous.

00:15:36.607 --> 00:15:37.641
Uh-huh.

00:15:37.708 --> 00:15:40.310
Seeing my ex with someone else

00:15:40.377 --> 00:15:41.712
makes me feel frustrated.

00:15:41.779 --> 00:15:43.514
Seems like it really got to you.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.316
I thought I was fine.

00:15:46.383 --> 00:15:49.219
I’m the type to stay friends
after a breakup, right?

00:15:49.286 --> 00:15:50.788
I wasn’t aware of that.

00:15:50.854 --> 00:15:52.823
So, I thought,
maybe if I start my next love,

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.091
I’d feel better.

00:15:54.658 --> 00:15:57.161
But the people you showed me now,

00:15:57.227 --> 00:15:59.396
none of them spark my interest.

00:15:59.463 --> 00:16:00.764
I just don’t know…

00:16:01.432 --> 00:16:02.499
what to do anymore.

00:16:03.834 --> 00:16:06.003
If I may say,

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.271
romance and whatnot,

00:16:07.337 --> 00:16:09.873
once you realize you can live without it,

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:10.874
life becomes easier.

00:16:11.442 --> 00:16:13.410
Is that how you’ve been living too,
Ms. Momose?

00:16:13.477 --> 00:16:14.311
That's right.

00:16:15.312 --> 00:16:16.380
With lots and lots

00:16:17.314 --> 00:16:18.348
of parfaits.

00:16:18.415 --> 00:16:19.516
Really?

00:16:19.583 --> 00:16:20.684
Did you get to talk to him?

00:16:21.251 --> 00:16:22.820
Not really.

00:16:22.886 --> 00:16:23.954
What are you doing?

00:16:25.055 --> 00:16:26.457
Thank you so much for today.

00:16:26.523 --> 00:16:28.192
Um, so…

00:16:28.258 --> 00:16:30.394
-Hey, Koi!
-Oh!

00:16:30.461 --> 00:16:31.862
-Hey!
-It's been a long time!

00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:32.763
What are you doing?

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.731
Oh sorry, were you with your friends?

00:16:34.798 --> 00:16:36.033
Ah, it’s fine.

00:16:36.567 --> 00:16:38.402
They know I’m gay.

00:16:38.469 --> 00:16:40.604
Oh, good.

00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:42.573
By the way, next time, this guy is going

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:44.074
to bring his boyfriend.

00:16:44.141 --> 00:16:45.909
It's because you've been pestering

00:16:45.976 --> 00:16:47.077
-to meet him.
-I'm curious!

00:16:47.144 --> 00:16:48.645
Oh, is it him?

00:16:48.712 --> 00:16:49.646
-Yep!
-Yeah!

00:16:49.713 --> 00:16:51.615
I was curious about him too.

00:16:51.682 --> 00:16:53.851
You’ve got an eye for guys, Koi.
Make sure he’s good.

00:16:53.917 --> 00:16:55.152
-That's not needed.
-Why?

00:16:55.219 --> 00:16:57.254
You'd better consult him!

00:16:57.321 --> 00:16:58.589
What are you afraid of?

00:16:58.655 --> 00:17:00.190
Alright, let's get in touch.

00:17:00.257 --> 00:17:01.558
Sorry for interrupting.

00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:03.093
-See you!
-Bye.

00:17:05.762 --> 00:17:08.298
We all worked at the same bar in 2-chōme.

00:17:08.365 --> 00:17:10.200
-They’re my friends.
-They all look so cool!

00:17:13.504 --> 00:17:14.872
Let’s all grab a meal next time.

00:17:15.639 --> 00:17:16.473
Sure.

00:17:17.574 --> 00:17:20.611
How about tomorrow?
Let’s bake sweet potatoes together.

00:17:22.212 --> 00:17:24.648
What’s with the whole "let’s bake
sweet potatoes" thing?

00:17:24.715 --> 00:17:26.049
Well,

00:17:26.116 --> 00:17:28.585
the landlady gave us so many…

00:17:29.853 --> 00:17:32.189
and I thought we might as well
have Koito join us too.

00:17:32.256 --> 00:17:34.091
He's really something else too.

00:17:34.158 --> 00:17:35.626
Without any hesitation,

00:17:35.692 --> 00:17:38.128
"Okay, tomorrow at Gen's place then.
Got it."

00:17:38.729 --> 00:17:39.796
No restraint at all, huh?

00:17:40.964 --> 00:17:42.166
That's very Koito-like.

00:17:42.766 --> 00:17:43.734
Sorry for not knowing.

00:17:44.635 --> 00:17:45.536
In the end…

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.071
I still haven’t apologized.

00:17:48.138 --> 00:17:50.440
He's probably already
forgotten by now, but…

00:17:57.281 --> 00:17:59.783
Here, feel free to have
a little snack while you work.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.418
Thank you.

00:18:01.485 --> 00:18:04.188
When the sweet potatoes are done,
I’ll bring them over.

00:18:04.755 --> 00:18:06.924
Do you like baked sweet potatoes,
Koinobori?

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.159
I guess so.

00:18:09.226 --> 00:18:11.795
Oh? Since you came all this way here,

00:18:11.862 --> 00:18:14.164
I thought you must really love them.

00:18:16.066 --> 00:18:17.568
Yeah, you're right.

00:18:17.634 --> 00:18:19.937
I like them. I very much do.

00:18:20.003 --> 00:18:21.004
I'm glad to hear that.

00:18:21.071 --> 00:18:21.939
Here,

00:18:22.005 --> 00:18:23.473
have some tea if you like.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.875
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

00:18:24.942 --> 00:18:26.276
-That's hot.
-Here.

00:18:26.343 --> 00:18:28.011
Thank you.

00:18:28.078 --> 00:18:29.713
The landlady who gave us sweet potatoes.

00:18:30.948 --> 00:18:32.082
And this is my frie--

00:18:32.849 --> 00:18:34.585
An old acquaintance of mine, Koito.

00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:35.652
Let's eat!

00:18:35.719 --> 00:18:38.789
I worked hard digging them out,
so please enjoy every bite.

00:18:38.855 --> 00:18:39.957
Thank you.

00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:46.964
What?

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.808
Ms. Matsu.

00:19:00.043 --> 00:19:02.079
-Hi.
-Are you perhaps…

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.915
-staking out?
-Something like that.

00:19:04.982 --> 00:19:06.083
Wow, so detective-like!

00:19:06.149 --> 00:19:07.818
I’m a police officer,

00:19:07.884 --> 00:19:09.186
not a detective.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.855
That’s not exactly
donuts and coffee, is it?

00:19:12.489 --> 00:19:15.192
Uh, what are Mr. Ichigaya
and the others doing?

00:19:15.792 --> 00:19:16.827
Mr. Jin Ichigaya, I mean.

00:19:17.694 --> 00:19:19.496
-Who?
-His stage name is Genichi Hatano.

00:19:20.564 --> 00:19:21.665
Oh, right!

00:19:21.732 --> 00:19:24.167
As you can see,
it's a baked sweet potato party.

00:19:24.234 --> 00:19:25.569
Why don't you join them?

00:19:26.136 --> 00:19:27.537
-I'm good.
-Is that so?

00:19:27.604 --> 00:19:29.139
Well then, I wish you luck.

00:19:29.206 --> 00:19:30.040
Thanks.

00:19:32.009 --> 00:19:34.177
I should crank up the heat more, right?

00:19:34.244 --> 00:19:35.846
-Hey, now.
-Stop!

00:19:37.481 --> 00:19:39.950
Sorry, I thought it was scrap paper.

00:19:40.851 --> 00:19:42.786
-You’re thinking of buying a house?
-Well…

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.821
It's just a thought.

00:19:44.888 --> 00:19:46.089
I worked hard and bought one

00:19:46.156 --> 00:19:48.592
-last year with my partner.
-What?

00:19:48.659 --> 00:19:50.894
We've been together
for a long time already.

00:19:51.428 --> 00:19:53.163
Oh, that's great!

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.464
Huh?

00:19:54.531 --> 00:19:55.699
Oh, right.

00:19:55.766 --> 00:19:58.035
I don’t usually get to show this
to anyone else.

00:19:58.769 --> 00:19:59.603
Here.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:01.705
Take a look.

00:20:01.772 --> 00:20:03.106
PARTNERSHIP CERTIFICATE

00:20:03.173 --> 00:20:04.241
What's this?

00:20:04.308 --> 00:20:06.443
It's proof that even
same-sex couples like us

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.279
are officially recognized
as family by the city.

00:20:09.346 --> 00:20:10.914
Like a marriage certificate?

00:20:10.981 --> 00:20:12.849
Not exactly.

00:20:12.916 --> 00:20:14.985
Legally, you still can’t get married.

00:20:15.552 --> 00:20:18.522
But there are a lot of things
you can only do as a family,

00:20:18.588 --> 00:20:21.325
such as insurance, company benefits,

00:20:21.391 --> 00:20:23.427
home loans, hospital visits,

00:20:23.493 --> 00:20:26.763
family discounts, etc.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.366
This makes it easier
to have those rights recognized.

00:20:29.433 --> 00:20:31.034
But most importantly,

00:20:31.101 --> 00:20:34.471
the city accepts us for who we are.

00:20:34.538 --> 00:20:35.906
I wished the country and law

00:20:35.972 --> 00:20:38.041
did the same.

00:20:38.108 --> 00:20:39.609
This is my first time seeing this.

00:20:40.243 --> 00:20:41.178
Me too.

00:20:43.947 --> 00:20:45.248
But I’m glad…

00:20:47.084 --> 00:20:48.852
you met someone who doesn’t disgust you.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.488
You called me that before, no?

00:20:52.889 --> 00:20:54.424
That I'm disgusting.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.896
It seems there’s plumbing under this room.

00:20:59.963 --> 00:21:01.765
No worries. Please give me a moment.

00:21:01.832 --> 00:21:03.367
I haven't opened this room recently.

00:21:05.802 --> 00:21:06.903
You scared me!

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.271
If it hadn't been opened lately,

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:09.940
could there be…

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.442
-bugs?
-Maybe.

00:21:12.509 --> 00:21:13.443
Giant spiders too?

00:21:14.077 --> 00:21:15.679
-Maybe.
-Are you oaky with it?

00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:21.251
-I know someone who'd be fine with it!
-Really?

00:21:27.924 --> 00:21:29.192
Done roasting yet?

00:21:29.259 --> 00:21:30.260
Leave some for me.

00:21:30.927 --> 00:21:31.995
Okay.

00:21:33.363 --> 00:21:34.564
Sorry about that.

00:21:36.433 --> 00:21:37.701
I got a little worked up.

00:21:37.768 --> 00:21:39.102
My words were harsh, right?

00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:40.570
No.

00:21:41.671 --> 00:21:43.140
Uh…

00:21:43.206 --> 00:21:44.040
-I…
-Over here!

00:21:44.107 --> 00:21:44.941
Okay.

00:21:46.376 --> 00:21:47.744
-Huh?
-What?

00:21:48.812 --> 00:21:50.814
-Hello.
-What are you doing here?

00:21:50.881 --> 00:21:52.082
She's staking out.

00:21:52.616 --> 00:21:54.618
Staking out? Is she a police officer?

00:21:56.787 --> 00:21:58.188
Are you being watched?

00:22:01.591 --> 00:22:03.326
I'm Matsu from Suginami Central Police.

00:22:03.393 --> 00:22:04.428
She was staking out.

00:22:04.494 --> 00:22:06.596
This place, you mean?

00:22:08.064 --> 00:22:09.866
Alright, I'm counting on you!

00:22:09.933 --> 00:22:11.034
Okay.

00:22:11.101 --> 00:22:12.836
-Is this place being staked out?
-Stand back.

00:22:12.903 --> 00:22:13.837
Okay.

00:22:19.376 --> 00:22:20.377
Seems safe.

00:22:20.911 --> 00:22:21.812
Thank you!

00:22:22.312 --> 00:22:23.947
Go ahead, please.

00:22:24.014 --> 00:22:25.649
-Please excuse us.
-Coming in.

00:22:28.185 --> 00:22:30.287
Is it okay if we move
the stuff out of the way?

00:22:30.353 --> 00:22:32.022
Huh? What stuff?

00:22:39.129 --> 00:22:41.932
I’m really, really sorry.

00:22:42.599 --> 00:22:45.001
-What?
-The way I treated you in middle school.

00:22:45.769 --> 00:22:47.037
I’ve wanted to apologize ever since.

00:22:47.871 --> 00:22:48.772
What did you do?

00:22:49.539 --> 00:22:50.607
I betrayed you.

00:22:51.608 --> 00:22:53.910
You were my best friend,
and yet I hurt you.

00:22:56.847 --> 00:22:58.582
I wanted to talk about that too.

00:22:59.549 --> 00:23:02.986
That’s why I thought the baked
sweet potato party might be my chance.

00:23:05.489 --> 00:23:07.791
I figured you’d still remember, Gen.

00:23:07.858 --> 00:23:10.060
And maybe you'd still be blaming yourself.

00:23:11.094 --> 00:23:12.896
-Huh?
-Back in middle school,

00:23:13.797 --> 00:23:16.633
I was always worried I might be gay.

00:23:17.934 --> 00:23:18.768
But…

00:23:19.503 --> 00:23:21.404
I couldn’t accept it myself.

00:23:21.471 --> 00:23:22.439
KŌJIEN DICTIONARY 3RD EDITION

00:23:22.506 --> 00:23:23.440
Even…

00:23:24.241 --> 00:23:26.710
the dictionary said it was "abnormal".

00:23:26.776 --> 00:23:28.712
GAY- AN ABNORMAL DESIRE
FOR SOMEONE OF THE SAME SEX

00:23:29.579 --> 00:23:31.348
And the health textbook said

00:23:31.414 --> 00:23:32.249
when you hit puberty,

00:23:32.315 --> 00:23:34.851
everyone starts getting interested
in the opposite sex…

00:23:34.918 --> 00:23:35.752
DEVELOP AN INTEREST IN THE OPPOSITE SEX

00:23:35.819 --> 00:23:38.555
so I tried not to think about it too much.

00:23:38.622 --> 00:23:39.756
Yay, I win!

00:23:39.823 --> 00:23:41.858
-You played dirty, Gen!
-I was always with you…

00:23:41.925 --> 00:23:43.560
-No, I didn't!
-Yes, you did!

00:23:43.627 --> 00:23:45.562
…and I really enjoyed your company.

00:23:45.629 --> 00:23:47.864
-So good!
-But so cold!

00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:49.165
But…

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.035
when the kids in class
started calling us gay…

00:23:52.102 --> 00:23:53.770
Homo!

00:23:53.837 --> 00:23:55.071
Homo!

00:23:59.476 --> 00:24:01.878
Don't touch me, gay! You're disgusting!

00:24:03.313 --> 00:24:04.180
I…

00:24:05.315 --> 00:24:07.117
was terrified that people
would know I was gay.

00:24:09.219 --> 00:24:11.655
I was going to shove you away too,
back then.

00:24:12.489 --> 00:24:15.191
-Really?
-It just so happened

00:24:15.258 --> 00:24:16.560
that you did it first.

00:24:17.394 --> 00:24:18.528
So, Gen,

00:24:18.595 --> 00:24:20.830
you don’t have to think
you're the only one at fault.

00:24:20.897 --> 00:24:22.032
No, but…

00:24:23.366 --> 00:24:24.601
I was just as much at fault.

00:24:24.668 --> 00:24:25.869
Did you like him?

00:24:28.338 --> 00:24:29.372
Yeah.

00:24:30.574 --> 00:24:31.675
More than I can say.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.148
I liked you too.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:41.618
You were my first love.

00:24:42.586 --> 00:24:44.487
So we both felt the same way
about each other?

00:24:46.122 --> 00:24:47.958
Past tense, mind you.

00:24:48.024 --> 00:24:49.426
Both of you "liked" each other.

00:24:49.492 --> 00:24:50.994
Don't get that wrong.

00:24:51.561 --> 00:24:52.395
Right…

00:24:52.462 --> 00:24:53.296
Yes.

00:24:54.564 --> 00:24:55.799
We "liked" each other.

00:24:55.865 --> 00:24:57.601
You two should’ve talked about it sooner.

00:24:58.435 --> 00:24:59.769
About how you really felt.

00:25:00.537 --> 00:25:02.505
Yeah. I do that now.

00:25:02.572 --> 00:25:03.473
With my partner, that is.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.008
We talk about everything.

00:25:05.542 --> 00:25:07.210
We even made a partnership declaration,

00:25:07.277 --> 00:25:09.746
took out a mortgage,
and bought a house together.

00:25:14.718 --> 00:25:16.353
Knitting…

00:25:17.487 --> 00:25:18.788
Hula dancing…

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:23.493
Trying my hand at clothes-making…

00:25:25.028 --> 00:25:27.330
And oh, painting.

00:25:28.031 --> 00:25:31.001
You’ve done so many things.

00:25:31.067 --> 00:25:33.236
I’ve been trying to find something I like.

00:25:34.304 --> 00:25:35.972
But I still haven’t found that one thing

00:25:36.039 --> 00:25:37.907
that really clicks.

00:25:39.109 --> 00:25:41.044
A whole fascinating history…

00:25:42.045 --> 00:25:43.046
of Inokashira.

00:25:43.113 --> 00:25:45.215
Well…

00:25:45.715 --> 00:25:47.851
Um, please have one, if you’d like.

00:25:48.518 --> 00:25:49.753
Thank you.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.288
-Here you go.
-Oh, thanks.

00:25:53.857 --> 00:25:56.026
Did you know? She's on a stakeout.

00:25:56.559 --> 00:25:58.028
May I know why you're here today?

00:25:58.094 --> 00:25:59.896
I can’t comment on ongoing investigations.

00:26:00.964 --> 00:26:01.998
So cool…

00:26:04.868 --> 00:26:05.902
I’ll be taking my leave.

00:26:08.405 --> 00:26:10.607
Could you tell me secretly?
Just between us.

00:26:10.674 --> 00:26:11.908
Take care!

00:26:13.243 --> 00:26:15.245
-She hasn’t noticed, right?
-What?

00:26:15.311 --> 00:26:16.446
About you acting as my dad.

00:26:17.914 --> 00:26:20.316
Let's just think we're fine.

00:26:22.218 --> 00:26:23.553
It's still here.

00:26:24.354 --> 00:26:26.589
That’s a terrible drawing!

00:26:26.656 --> 00:26:28.358
MOTHER’S DAY: PORTRAIT CORNER

00:26:28.425 --> 00:26:31.094
Huh? How did you even know I’d be here?

00:26:31.161 --> 00:26:33.830
Well, I'm your ex. Of course, I’d know.

00:26:33.897 --> 00:26:35.298
Come to papa.

00:26:36.299 --> 00:26:38.068
-What's that?
-I took it in.

00:26:38.601 --> 00:26:40.236
I’ll take care of it till it dies.

00:26:40.303 --> 00:26:42.872
Ain’t that right, cutie?

00:26:42.939 --> 00:26:44.174
HAPPY STORE

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.276
Hey! Where are you off to next?

00:26:46.342 --> 00:26:47.477
Thanks for coming today.

00:26:48.478 --> 00:26:50.413
Next time, come over my place.
Everyone’s invited.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.115
Are you sure? I'd love that!

00:26:52.182 --> 00:26:53.450
Oh, yes.

00:26:53.516 --> 00:26:55.518
There’s something I wanted to ask.

00:26:56.152 --> 00:26:57.320
What is it?

00:26:57.387 --> 00:26:58.354
Um, you see…

00:26:59.122 --> 00:27:02.358
I’m not actually her real parent.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.595
There’s a lot behind it, but…

00:27:07.664 --> 00:27:08.732
Is there a way

00:27:08.798 --> 00:27:10.100
for someone to become

00:27:10.166 --> 00:27:12.802
the legal parent
of another person's child?

00:27:13.837 --> 00:27:15.472
Like adopting them, for instance?

00:27:15.538 --> 00:27:16.673
Or becoming a foster parent?

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.174
Well, I guess that's different.

00:27:18.975 --> 00:27:21.578
When you said you wanted
to buy a house with someone important…

00:27:22.245 --> 00:27:23.747
is Hotaru in the equation too?

00:27:25.615 --> 00:27:26.983
I’m not sure yet.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.353
You’re kind, Gen.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.654
No, it’s not like that.

00:27:31.721 --> 00:27:33.957
Come by our office sometime.

00:27:34.023 --> 00:27:36.192
We’ve got counselors
who know all about that stuff.

00:27:36.259 --> 00:27:38.228
-Let's figure it out together.
-Okay, thanks.

00:27:38.294 --> 00:27:40.130
Oh, right. Let’s exchange contacts.

00:27:41.598 --> 00:27:43.032
I don't have my phone with me.

00:27:43.099 --> 00:27:44.434
You can type yours in then.

00:27:48.505 --> 00:27:50.273
-Presbyopia?
-Yeah, I guess.

00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:53.042
Here, use this.

00:27:53.743 --> 00:27:56.246
You used to wear round ones
like these, no?

00:27:56.312 --> 00:27:57.180
Did I?

00:27:57.247 --> 00:27:58.581
I used to like

00:27:59.149 --> 00:28:00.583
watching you from the back row, Gen,

00:28:01.117 --> 00:28:02.519
with your glasses on.

00:28:03.353 --> 00:28:06.222
I kept staring through your glasses.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.525
Wondering what you were looking at

00:28:08.591 --> 00:28:10.260
and what you were thinking.

00:28:11.094 --> 00:28:14.230
When you hit puberty, you begin
to develop interest in the opposite sex.

00:28:14.297 --> 00:28:17.367
Some may show interest in the same sex,

00:28:17.433 --> 00:28:20.270
but that’s just a passing phase.

00:28:21.504 --> 00:28:23.206
Oh, I’m not gay, by the way.

00:28:26.109 --> 00:28:27.510
You sure about that?

00:28:31.381 --> 00:28:33.149
The current one
looks better on you, though.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.456
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

00:28:46.663 --> 00:28:48.331
I knew you'd come to see Hotaru.

00:28:49.632 --> 00:28:50.500
Right?

00:28:54.137 --> 00:28:55.805
Glad the stairs got fixed so quickly.

00:28:58.074 --> 00:28:59.175
Thanks for having me.

00:29:04.881 --> 00:29:06.616
Are you collecting these?

00:29:06.683 --> 00:29:08.785
No, it's not me.

00:29:11.354 --> 00:29:12.355
Hotaru.

00:29:14.691 --> 00:29:15.525
Mom?

00:29:15.592 --> 00:29:17.627
-What?
-Huh?

00:29:17.694 --> 00:29:18.862
Tomoe?

00:29:19.562 --> 00:29:20.563
I’m here too, you know.

00:29:28.538 --> 00:29:29.572
-What?
-Huh?

00:29:29.639 --> 00:29:32.342
Did you think I’d run up and hug you
while crying tears of joy?

00:29:32.408 --> 00:29:33.576
Hey, that's dangerous!

00:29:33.643 --> 00:29:36.012
Maybe a little, sorry.

00:29:36.079 --> 00:29:37.947
Even if you apologize,
I won’t forgive you!

00:29:38.014 --> 00:29:39.482
-Hey, now.
-That can't do.

00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:40.617
Let go of me!

00:29:40.683 --> 00:29:41.784
Hey!

00:29:41.851 --> 00:29:42.952
Come on, Hotaru.

00:29:43.019 --> 00:29:45.088
-Hey!
-Stop!

00:29:46.723 --> 00:29:47.724
Have you calmed down?

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:48.992
Not at all.

00:29:49.058 --> 00:29:50.059
Well then!

00:29:50.126 --> 00:29:53.529
Then let’s talk this through,
all of us, okay?

00:29:53.596 --> 00:29:54.597
I have a question.

00:29:54.664 --> 00:29:55.565
Yes, Sakuta?

00:29:55.632 --> 00:29:58.501
I’ve been Hotaru’s homeroom teacher
since her third year. I’m Sakuta.

00:29:58.568 --> 00:30:00.870
I’ll skip the details,

00:30:00.937 --> 00:30:02.672
but I'm living in this apartment now.

00:30:02.739 --> 00:30:05.808
Um, did you really embezzle the money?

00:30:07.176 --> 00:30:09.612
I was wondering that too. Oh, I'm--

00:30:09.679 --> 00:30:10.780
This is the guy

00:30:10.847 --> 00:30:12.982
pretending to be Hotaru’s dad
when he’s gay.

00:30:13.583 --> 00:30:15.919
I was the one who asked him to.

00:30:15.985 --> 00:30:18.154
I’m Hatano. I live here too.

00:30:18.721 --> 00:30:21.557
I’m really sorry.
I've caused you all trouble.

00:30:23.192 --> 00:30:25.061
So, about the embezzlement…

00:30:28.331 --> 00:30:29.165
Yes, I did it.

00:30:29.766 --> 00:30:31.467
You really did, huh?

00:30:31.534 --> 00:30:32.669
You did, huh?

00:30:32.735 --> 00:30:36.406
Tomoe had her own reasons for doing so,
am I right?

00:30:36.472 --> 00:30:37.440
What reasons?

00:30:38.508 --> 00:30:40.143
Before I knew it, I had done it.

00:30:40.843 --> 00:30:45.014
Maybe I shouldn’t be saying this, but…

00:30:45.081 --> 00:30:45.949
Absolutely.

00:30:46.015 --> 00:30:47.517
The fake dad shouldn't say a thing.

00:30:47.583 --> 00:30:48.651
You keep quiet too.

00:30:48.718 --> 00:30:51.220
I think it's a little too selfish of you.

00:30:51.788 --> 00:30:55.291
Hotaru must've been really cornered to ask
someone like me to act as her parent.

00:30:55.358 --> 00:30:58.628
As Hotaru's homeroom teacher, I've to say

00:30:58.695 --> 00:31:00.863
this is a really important time for her.

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:01.764
I hope you underst--

00:31:01.831 --> 00:31:03.700
Please do not badmouth my mom!

00:31:03.766 --> 00:31:04.867
Oh…

00:31:06.903 --> 00:31:08.538
I'm so sorry about this.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.708
Stay here…

00:31:16.179 --> 00:31:18.214
I can't do that yet.

00:31:19.215 --> 00:31:20.483
-Sorry.
-Why?

00:31:22.285 --> 00:31:24.087
You wouldn’t understand,
even if I tell you.

00:31:25.288 --> 00:31:26.389
Even so, tell me.

00:31:26.456 --> 00:31:27.623
I want to know too.

00:31:34.163 --> 00:31:35.465
A dream.

00:31:36.666 --> 00:31:41.437
-What dream?
-I never had dreams.

00:31:43.306 --> 00:31:46.242
Be it school, work, marriage, or kids.

00:31:46.876 --> 00:31:48.011
Now that I think about it,

00:31:48.711 --> 00:31:52.115
I just followed what everyone else did.

00:31:52.181 --> 00:31:54.317
There was probably nothing
I really wanted.

00:31:55.952 --> 00:31:56.853
But…

00:31:58.021 --> 00:31:59.355
while I was on the run,

00:31:59.422 --> 00:32:01.691
I found those keychains.

00:32:01.758 --> 00:32:02.725
And I remembered.

00:32:03.292 --> 00:32:05.962
Collecting all 47 of them

00:32:06.896 --> 00:32:08.631
was my childhood dream.

00:32:09.198 --> 00:32:12.035
I kept at it little by little
until I started working.

00:32:12.101 --> 00:32:12.935
Now,

00:32:13.536 --> 00:32:14.604
I know what you’re thinking.

00:32:15.104 --> 00:32:16.873
"That’s it?" Right?

00:32:17.807 --> 00:32:20.710
But when I remembered my dream,

00:32:20.777 --> 00:32:21.944
I was glad.

00:32:23.479 --> 00:32:24.981
Like, "Oh yeah, a dream,

00:32:25.615 --> 00:32:27.417
I did have one."

00:32:29.185 --> 00:32:31.054
I do feel bad for Hotaru,

00:32:31.854 --> 00:32:34.290
but I don’t know what the future holds.

00:32:34.357 --> 00:32:37.093
So, if I want to fulfil that dream,
it has to be now.

00:32:38.428 --> 00:32:39.328
So…

00:32:39.829 --> 00:32:40.696
the keychains.

00:32:41.397 --> 00:32:43.499
Until I collect all 47 of them…

00:32:45.168 --> 00:32:46.235
I can’t go home.

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:48.871
You've seriously lost me.

00:32:48.938 --> 00:32:51.207
Don't worry, you're not alone.

00:32:51.274 --> 00:32:52.842
You can't relate?

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:57.980
Since I haven’t been able to fulfill
such a silly dream like this,

00:32:58.047 --> 00:33:02.552
it’s been stuck in my throat
like a fishbone this whole time.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.055
I hate myself for it.

00:33:07.857 --> 00:33:09.292
I can’t even fulfil such a dream,

00:33:10.059 --> 00:33:13.362
so how can I expect anything else
to work out?

00:33:15.231 --> 00:33:16.099
Don’t you get that?

00:33:16.165 --> 00:33:17.533
I don't.

00:33:18.835 --> 00:33:20.169
What about you, Inokashira?

00:33:22.271 --> 00:33:23.406
Well…

00:33:26.576 --> 00:33:29.278
-What about you, Hatano?
-Hey, why don't you ask me too?

00:33:29.345 --> 00:33:30.480
I sort of get it.

00:33:31.781 --> 00:33:33.015
Back in middle school,

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:35.017
there was someone I hurt,

00:33:35.685 --> 00:33:37.386
but I never got to say sorry,

00:33:37.453 --> 00:33:39.489
and that stung me.

00:33:40.723 --> 00:33:43.226
But today, I got to talk to him.

00:33:43.292 --> 00:33:46.129
That stung has now become a little prick.

00:33:47.063 --> 00:33:47.897
It feels like

00:33:47.964 --> 00:33:51.567
something new could start
from here, finally.

00:33:52.735 --> 00:33:54.270
It's just a feeling, you know?

00:33:54.337 --> 00:33:56.472
-Don't you agree?
-What?

00:33:56.539 --> 00:33:58.374
When a little bone is stuck
in your throat,

00:33:58.441 --> 00:33:59.842
you just have to reach in

00:33:59.909 --> 00:34:02.178
and pull it out, huh!

00:34:02.245 --> 00:34:03.713
Once, I couldn’t get one out,

00:34:03.779 --> 00:34:06.082
so I kept on eating rice to force it down.

00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:08.317
It’s impossible to get it out
like that, isn’t it?

00:34:08.384 --> 00:34:10.987
It’s apparently a superstition.
It only makes it go deeper.

00:34:11.053 --> 00:34:11.988
Really?

00:34:12.054 --> 00:34:13.890
It just fills your stomach, and that’s it.

00:34:13.956 --> 00:34:14.824
Guess what?

00:34:14.891 --> 00:34:17.960
I had surgery for it at a hospital.

00:34:18.027 --> 00:34:19.295
-What?
-Whoa!

00:34:19.362 --> 00:34:21.397
They pried my mouth open like this…

00:34:21.964 --> 00:34:22.798
You're lying.

00:34:22.865 --> 00:34:24.033
No, really.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.636
Something this huge went down my thro--

00:34:26.702 --> 00:34:29.238
-Ah! Hot!
-Oh!

00:34:29.305 --> 00:34:30.873
-So hot!
-Are you okay?

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:31.974
-Shall I dry your pants?
-Ugh!

00:34:32.041 --> 00:34:33.342
Just what are you doing?

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:34.243
Man…

00:34:38.781 --> 00:34:39.982
-Huh?
-Well…

00:34:41.217 --> 00:34:42.985
I know, it’s pathetic…

00:34:44.554 --> 00:34:45.555
I’m not young anymore,

00:34:46.923 --> 00:34:49.192
and yet, why am I such a failure?

00:34:49.258 --> 00:34:51.260
You're just getting started, no?

00:34:51.327 --> 00:34:53.496
You still have to take care of the rabbit.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.531
I’m trying to change.

00:34:55.598 --> 00:34:56.999
That’s commendable.

00:34:57.867 --> 00:34:59.902
Don’t worry, it’ll dry soon.

00:35:01.671 --> 00:35:02.572
For a gay,

00:35:03.472 --> 00:35:05.074
you're surprisingly decent, huh?

00:35:06.309 --> 00:35:07.210
Um…

00:35:08.878 --> 00:35:10.279
Like, what are all of you up to?

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.747
Sorry.

00:35:12.682 --> 00:35:13.950
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

00:35:14.016 --> 00:35:15.051
Whatever.

00:35:16.152 --> 00:35:19.522
You’ll be satisfied once you collect
all 47 of them, right?

00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:24.260
Just three more, right? I counted.

00:35:27.163 --> 00:35:27.997
Then…

00:35:28.965 --> 00:35:31.867
go get it over with and come back quickly.

00:35:39.609 --> 00:35:41.077
I’m sorry, everyone.

00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:44.880
Please take care of my daughter.

00:35:58.861 --> 00:36:00.062
Mom.

00:36:02.865 --> 00:36:03.899
Take these with you.

00:36:09.805 --> 00:36:11.040
Mom.

00:36:14.677 --> 00:36:17.680
Do you… love me?

00:36:23.953 --> 00:36:26.889
Before… coming here,

00:36:28.824 --> 00:36:30.960
I went to the family restaurant
we used to go.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.395
You remember?

00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:35.598
The one where you liked
mixing corn soup with rice.

00:36:36.465 --> 00:36:37.300
And

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.736
the guinea pig park too.

00:36:40.803 --> 00:36:42.838
Even the supermarket’s portrait corner

00:36:42.905 --> 00:36:44.206
where you drew me.

00:36:44.273 --> 00:36:45.241
I went around those spots.

00:36:47.743 --> 00:36:48.577
I’ve always…

00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:51.414
loved you, every age

00:36:53.049 --> 00:36:54.550
you’ve ever been, Hotaru.

00:36:57.386 --> 00:36:58.220
I’m leaving now.

00:37:00.056 --> 00:37:00.956
Have a good trip.

00:37:17.973 --> 00:37:19.809
Sorry for touching it without asking.

00:37:20.509 --> 00:37:21.677
It’s fine. You can touch it.

00:37:25.648 --> 00:37:26.849
There.

00:37:27.817 --> 00:37:30.786
Should I hate my mom for what she did?

00:37:32.021 --> 00:37:34.223
-What?
-She stole money,

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:36.459
and just when I thought she came back,

00:37:36.525 --> 00:37:38.094
she left for somewhere again.

00:37:41.597 --> 00:37:42.765
She's terrible, isn't she?

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.069
But there are things I like about her,

00:37:49.004 --> 00:37:51.006
and there are things
I don’t like too, after all.

00:37:52.975 --> 00:37:53.976
Right now,

00:37:54.543 --> 00:37:57.079
whether I’m angry or sad…

00:37:57.146 --> 00:37:58.381
I can’t even tell.

00:38:00.149 --> 00:38:02.418
I don’t even know
if I should’ve tried stopping her.

00:38:03.285 --> 00:38:04.120
Not at all.

00:38:07.089 --> 00:38:09.125
And my mom’s feelings too…

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.861
I don’t get it at all.

00:38:19.935 --> 00:38:20.770
Honestly…

00:38:22.171 --> 00:38:23.406
I just don’t get any of it.

00:38:30.946 --> 00:38:32.181
Here.

00:38:36.886 --> 00:38:38.854
You don’t have to understand it now.

00:38:41.056 --> 00:38:43.025
Whether you like or hate her,

00:38:43.926 --> 00:38:45.060
there's no need to decide.

00:38:46.429 --> 00:38:47.730
No need to rush.

00:38:49.665 --> 00:38:50.733
Mr. Hatano.

00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:53.936
How old are you again now?

00:38:54.804 --> 00:38:55.671
Fifty years old.

00:38:57.006 --> 00:38:58.140
Are you having fun?

00:38:58.774 --> 00:38:59.708
At 50 years old?

00:39:01.377 --> 00:39:02.611
Yeah.

00:39:02.678 --> 00:39:03.512
That’s a lie.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.482
By the time I turn 50,

00:39:06.549 --> 00:39:08.150
life will likely be so hard,
I’ll just die.

00:39:09.652 --> 00:39:11.720
I mean, it already hurts this much now.

00:39:12.788 --> 00:39:14.156
It’s not a lie.

00:39:14.223 --> 00:39:16.525
Getting older has its good sides too.

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.262
Then tell me one.

00:39:20.896 --> 00:39:21.964
Huh?

00:39:22.031 --> 00:39:23.265
So sudden…

00:39:25.234 --> 00:39:26.569
My knees ache

00:39:27.436 --> 00:39:30.606
when it’s about to rain.
I guess that’s something.

00:39:31.907 --> 00:39:33.609
-Anything else?
-What else?

00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:35.244
Let me think…

00:39:36.178 --> 00:39:37.313
Oh, by the window,

00:39:37.379 --> 00:39:39.148
I’ve been growing pea sprouts.

00:39:39.215 --> 00:39:40.483
It's incredible, you know?

00:39:40.549 --> 00:39:42.218
They grow at crazy speed.

00:39:42.284 --> 00:39:45.054
And when I see them pushing so hard
to keep growing,

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.722
it kinda makes me want to cry.

00:39:47.289 --> 00:39:49.425
Like, bawling, while brushing my teeth.

00:39:49.992 --> 00:39:53.229
I guess you start getting moved
by the tiniest things.

00:39:53.896 --> 00:39:55.331
Every day I feel touched!

00:39:56.398 --> 00:39:57.366
What the heck?

00:39:57.433 --> 00:39:59.735
-What else?
-Uh…

00:40:00.469 --> 00:40:03.272
When I was little,
I really hated cucumbers.

00:40:03.839 --> 00:40:06.542
I’d even sneak them into the trash
at lunch if I found them.

00:40:07.276 --> 00:40:09.945
But now? I love cucumbers.

00:40:10.579 --> 00:40:12.281
And that kinda makes me happy.

00:40:13.249 --> 00:40:14.083
What the hell?

00:40:15.851 --> 00:40:17.553
The things you dislike decrease,

00:40:18.487 --> 00:40:20.756
and the things you like increase.

00:40:21.457 --> 00:40:22.892
I guess that's what it means to age.

00:40:23.692 --> 00:40:24.927
It’s fun.

00:40:25.494 --> 00:40:26.395
So, you like…

00:40:28.564 --> 00:40:29.632
Mr. Sakuta?

00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:32.001
What? Why do you ask?

00:40:32.067 --> 00:40:33.736
I can just tell by looking.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.476
Yeah, I like Sakuta.

00:40:51.053 --> 00:40:54.023
It’s going to sting later
if you rub it like that.

00:40:56.892 --> 00:40:57.726
Okay.

00:40:58.494 --> 00:40:59.562
Wear this.

00:41:01.263 --> 00:41:02.498
What's that?

00:41:02.565 --> 00:41:04.767
Reading glasses. Go on.

00:41:04.833 --> 00:41:06.902
Getting farsighted
isn’t exactly a good thing.

00:41:06.969 --> 00:41:08.003
Come on.

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:10.105
Just try it on, okay?

00:41:15.377 --> 00:41:16.979
Maybe it's better you close your eyes.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:22.184
Face this side.

00:41:22.952 --> 00:41:24.053
Yeah, just like that.

00:41:30.025 --> 00:41:33.195
This way, all your tears get absorbed.

00:41:33.262 --> 00:41:36.398
Hacks like this are something you learn

00:41:37.433 --> 00:41:38.567
when you get older.

00:41:39.768 --> 00:41:40.703
What's this?

00:41:41.537 --> 00:41:42.871
I can't see a thing.

00:41:44.773 --> 00:41:47.376
That’s the point. You can still have fun.

00:41:48.644 --> 00:41:49.511
Even at 50 years old.

00:41:55.851 --> 00:41:57.886
After the beep tone,

00:41:57.953 --> 00:42:00.856
please leave your name and message.

00:42:01.423 --> 00:42:02.858
Hello, Mom?

00:42:03.559 --> 00:42:06.428
Where are you now?
I hope you find those keychains.

00:42:07.196 --> 00:42:09.198
The things I like…

00:42:09.264 --> 00:42:11.200
I think I’m kind of starting
to figure it out.

00:42:11.266 --> 00:42:13.369
Happy 71st birthday!

00:42:13.435 --> 00:42:15.537
Congrats!

00:42:15.604 --> 00:42:17.139
So, for now,

00:42:17.206 --> 00:42:19.041
I’ll just try my best
until I’m 50 years old.

00:42:19.108 --> 00:42:19.942
KOHARU IS 10 YEARS OLD

00:42:20.509 --> 00:42:21.877
In the meantime,

00:42:21.944 --> 00:42:25.314
I’ll be waiting to welcome you home, Mom.

00:42:25.881 --> 00:42:26.715
Bye.

00:42:27.449 --> 00:42:28.317
Talk to you soon.

00:42:32.855 --> 00:42:34.390
Why 50 years old, though?

00:42:40.996 --> 00:42:42.197
Enjoy.

00:42:50.639 --> 00:42:52.641
So, how did the matter with your ex go?

00:42:55.644 --> 00:42:58.113
I still can't let him go.

00:42:59.548 --> 00:43:01.550
Yeah. We just can't give up that easily.

00:43:02.217 --> 00:43:03.485
Huh?

00:43:03.552 --> 00:43:05.854
Maybe the only way
is to throw caution to the wind

00:43:05.921 --> 00:43:08.724
and lay all your feelings out there.

00:43:14.863 --> 00:43:16.999
Everything’s so expensive. Seriously.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.168
Yes.

00:43:20.836 --> 00:43:23.272
I guess we should start
by figuring out a budget.

00:43:24.406 --> 00:43:25.240
Yes.

00:43:26.675 --> 00:43:29.278
Maybe the partnership stuff
should come first?

00:43:31.213 --> 00:43:32.347
Um, Sakuta…

00:43:32.414 --> 00:43:33.949
Isn’t this…

00:43:34.483 --> 00:43:36.418
leading up to buying a house?

00:43:37.119 --> 00:43:39.321
Living together…

00:43:40.155 --> 00:43:42.357
I want to experience the activities
that come with it.

00:43:42.424 --> 00:43:44.827
So, does that mean, um…

00:43:47.296 --> 00:43:48.731
our feelings are mutual?

00:43:48.797 --> 00:43:49.698
Yeah,

00:43:51.633 --> 00:43:54.737
-I guess.
-You're saying you like me, yes?

00:43:57.005 --> 00:43:58.073
Pretty much.

00:44:01.844 --> 00:44:02.811
What's with that face?

00:44:06.115 --> 00:44:08.617
Could you say it louder and more clear--

00:44:08.684 --> 00:44:09.585
Are we buying it or not?

00:44:09.651 --> 00:44:11.653
We are. Let's buy it!
