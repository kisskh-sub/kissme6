[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 19]

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.590
How did I end up drinking so much?

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.750
Drinking only causes trouble.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.920
You sleep very soundly.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.710
It's almost dawn.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.520
Honey,

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.880
have you really forgotten

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.440
what you said to me

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.040
and what you did last night?

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.110
I...

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.840
What did I say?

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.270
What did I do?

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.800
You said

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.550
you like me.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.590
You held me tight and wouldn't let go.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.670
Nonsense.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.360
Impossible.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.400
Whether it is nonsense or not,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.230
you know the truth well enough.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.710
Your Highness, the Madam Dowager
wants to see you.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.590
Now,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.270
Su Mansion is gone.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.320
Your father is dead too.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.440
You should come back
to the countryside with me.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.590
If you want to go back,
go back yourself.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.840
I will never admit defeat.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.040
I'll rise again, stronger than before.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.630
Feiyi, Feiyi.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.920
Feiyi.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.480
Madam.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.800
Qingran.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.190
These are your mother's jewelry.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.960
She gave them to me back then

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.630
and asked me to take good care of you.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.670
I went back on my word.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.750
These should be returned to you.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.920
My sins still can't be washed away.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.670
Since I learned it wasn't your fault
pushing me into the water,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.440
I've regretted it day and night.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.520
I don't blame you
for how things ended up.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.040
I'm going back to the countryside.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.000
All these years,

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.880
I kept trying to fit
into this bustling city,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.960
but I never felt at ease.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.710
I still prefer growing vegetables

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.630
and raising pigs in the countryside.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.710
Qingran,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.550
before we part,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.230
would you still call me Grandmother?

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.880
Grandmother.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.330
The dust of the world has settled,

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.960
no matter how many grudges remain,

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.440
time will never turn back.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.480
Here's some silver for you.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.750
The road ahead is long,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.230
better to be prepared.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.520
Qingran,

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.270

What do you want?

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.800
Stay away from me.
Don't touch me. Get lost.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.540
Stop right there.

Get lost.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.360
Let's go.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.110
Seeing me looking so defeated,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.890
you must be feeling pretty proud, huh?

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.220
Don't think that just because
you saved me,

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.590
I will be deeply grateful to you.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.270
You're not worthy of that at all.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.360
I told you,

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.520
I lost.

But you won't win either.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.840
You'll always be my defeated opponent.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.000
I never expected you to still be alive.

Wen Yueqian.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.670
And so?

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.920
You've been abandoned.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.320
I'll make everyone know

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.000
that you're not the real Su Qingran.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.360
You're Wen Yueqian,
daughter of the criminal Wen Muchen.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.630
I'll ruin your name
and everything you have.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.000
Where's the proof?

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.330
If you and I prove our bond
with a blood test,

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.270
it will show we are not true sisters

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.360
and you are not my father's daughter.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.670
Everyone knows your mother's affairs.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.750
If we do the blood test,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.040
by then, who knows

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.190
who is an illegitimate child?

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.920
You!

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.360
Su Feiyi, you are now
just a convicted person.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.880
And yet you dare threaten me.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.400
Listen closely.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.400
I won't let you die so easily.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.320
I want you to live like a filthy rat
on the street,

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.920
experiencing the feeling
of being worse than death.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.920
Save me. Save me.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:46.840
Wanyan Qi,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.800
I can't save you.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.230
Someone.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.070
Young Master Qi is unwell.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:55.400
Call the physician at once.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.590
What's going on?

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.150
Son! Son!

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.590
Come quickly and help.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.040
Hurry up and help him up.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.070
Yes.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.800
Su Qingran,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.750
I...

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.920
Your Highness,

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.800
how could you repay kindness
with cruelty?

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.710
You heartless woman!

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.430
You just stood there
watching Qi lying on the ground,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.070
without even helping him up.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.800
Do you not know

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.730
about no physical contact
between men and women?

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.550
It wouldn't be proper for me
to help him up.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.310
You...

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.310
Hurry and get him up.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.190
Quick.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.000
Qi,

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.040
you're finally awake.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.600
Your illness is getting worse.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.600
This time, you've been unconscious
for three days.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.350
If only Wen Yueqian were still alive,
with her blood to nourish you,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.110
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.310
During these days you were unconscious,

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.510
your father hasn't come
to see you even once.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.800
But Wanyan Jin

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.880
is gaining more favor from your father.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.470
If Wanyan Jin inherits the throne,

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.310
there will be no place for us here.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.760
With my condition,

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.510
my father has looked down on me
for a long time.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.040
Before, I was his only son,

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.760
so he had to tolerate me.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.040
Now there's a son stronger
and more capable than me,

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.920
of course I can't compare.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:27.760
What if your father only had you
as his only son?

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.000
Qi, rest assured,

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.640
I will never let that unworthy son

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.070
take away the throne
that belongs to you.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.920
My Consort, why did you

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.470
gather everyone here?

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.390
I want to announce an important matter.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.640
It concerns the safety of our mansion.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.390
Bring the person in.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.390
This is the midwife
who delivered the crown prince.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.110
According to her,

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.720
the crown prince had a birthmark

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.040
on his waist at birth.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.650
I asked the maidservant
who attended the crown prince.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.920
She said

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.230
she never saw any birthmark.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.680
Jin,

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.800
how do you explain this?
