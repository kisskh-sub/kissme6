A month has already passed
after coming to this world...

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.620
Alright, I'll leave the specifics to you.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.500
Got it.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.260
I thought you liked sweets.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.350
What?

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.710
It's nothing.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.040
You've just been quieter.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.020
I thought you weren't feeling well.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.460
I'm fine...

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.440
That's good.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.680
Okay.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.260
Let's go.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.010
I never thought I would feel this way...
about Ogami.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.390
They made their decision on the spot.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.150
That's because he trusts us.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.270
I'll set up another get-together
for you all next time.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.760
Ogami, you're incredible.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.600
Huh?

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.770
What's incredible?

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.851
Oh, nothing. It's just that the speed
at which you close a deal is amazing.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.500
You think so?

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.230
Seems like business as usual to me.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.060
Business as usual...

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.826
By the way, why are you talking
like you had nothing to do with it?

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.690
Huh?

00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:01.590
Didn't we land this contract together?

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.780
I'm really counting on you.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.010
Partner.

(Photo from the New Year's party)

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.540
Am I finally...

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.060
slowly becoming the me of this world?

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.820
It's unimaginable for the
Ogami from the other world.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.710
The Ogami from my original world...

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.590
will I never see him again?

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:49.000
"Love Begins in the World of If"
(Episode 4)

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.780
Alright, I'm off.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.360
Kano.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.540
Yeah?

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.240
You're heading to Sato-san's, right?

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:58.650
I'm coming with you.

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.670
Huh?

00:03:59.671 --> 00:04:02.319
But today is the final
discussion on the technical side.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.010
I can handle it myself.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.490
He's probably just playing nice.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.560
Playing nice?

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.550
Leave it to me.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Let's go.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.310
Okay, we'll proceed as discussed.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.730
Lastly...

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.380
On this screen...

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.580
it'd be great if you could
add a field for the total amount.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.470
Also...

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.800
the overall color scheme...

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.840
I'd like it to be a bit brighter.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.850
Uh...

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.240
- If we do that...
- We'd appreciate it.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.229
Right... I understand.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.639
If we change the specifications...

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.060
the price will also change.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.610
It's just a minor change.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.020
If we add this feature now
without extending the deadline...

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.219
we'll have to assign
more people to handle it.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.230
So an increase in cost is unavoidable.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.040
Um...

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.210
it would cost about this much extra.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.960
Hmm...

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.260
What are your thoughts?

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.020
Well, in that case...

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.040
Man... I haven't broken out in
a cold sweat like that in ages.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.510
See? I told you.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.040
The guy was just playing nice.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.300
Yeah.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.790
I can't believe he asked
for revisions at this stage.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.150
He probably thought he could push it through
by bringing it up at the last minute.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.080
And the proof is... you were about to agree
to that super annoying change, weren't you?

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.210
I figured before talking
to the tech department...

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.340
I could just handle the
internal design myself.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.320
What kind of salesperson
does internal design?

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.380
Well, that's true, but...

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.370
Because it's you...

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.310
I figured you'd give in
to Sato-san's demands.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.000
Just as I thought.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.160
You could have just told me.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.290
As soon as he knew he was
dealing with a rookie salesman...

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.330
I knew Sato-san would
make unreasonable demands.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.530
But we ended up raising
the price anyway, didn't we?

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.600
That's true.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.220
You're sales tech.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.730
Your job is to support me.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.090
Oh, right.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.890
Since we successfully closed the deal...

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.750
let's have a celebration tomorrow.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.390
A celebration?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.680
That's right.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.260
At your place.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.760
Huh?

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:03.780
Hmm?

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.670
My place?

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.120
Your place.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.590
Why does it have to be at my place?

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.090
What's the big deal?

00:07:15.091 --> 00:07:16.980
Besides, we've had a barbecue here before.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.000
I even let him in my house...

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.730
the "me" of this world.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.140
What's wrong?

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.260
You don't want to?

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.000
It's not that I don't want to.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.990
Um... by the way, can I eat this?

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.110
Sure.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.140
A relative sent me a huge box.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.040
I can't finish it all by myself.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.990
I bet you could finish it.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.840
I wanted to share it with you.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.360
Okay.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.880
Here.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.010
I grilled this for you.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.390
- No, no, you eat it.
- Open up.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.760
- You don't have to.
- Come on.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.470
How is it?

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:14.690
It's hot!

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.780
Hmm?

00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:17.190
What'd you say?

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.920
It's delicious...

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.500
See? Told you.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.410
Alright.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.230
Here.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.149
- No, my mouth is full.
- Come on, open up.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.199
- You have it.
- Come on.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.200
Really, I'm fine.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:36.950
Mmm.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.720
Delicious.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.220
So it's true. Good quality meat
doesn't make you feel bloated.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.420
Of course not.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.530
What is it?

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.040
Tonight...

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.070
it's not just about the meat.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:03.630
Taiyaki?

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.180
Russian Roulette Taiyaki.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.920
Isn't that something college kids do?

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.260
It's fun, isn't it?

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.590
Let's play.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:17.210
One of these is super spicy.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.190
It's a penalty game.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.820
Oh, sorry, but I actually like spicy food.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.210
- No way.
- It's true.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.570
What about you, Ogami?

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:31.050
I can't handle it...

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.936
Then isn't Ogami the only
one playing the penalty game?

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.149
- You set me up.
- No, I didn't.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.530
You dug your own grave.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.470
Suddenly, I'm getting nervous.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.140
I'm not nervous at all.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.430
Oh really?

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.590
Well then...

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.740
I'll take this one.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.540
Then I'll take this one...

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.680
Okay.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.500
Ready to eat?

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.680
Ready...

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:05.930
So spicy!!

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.570
I knew it.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.340
Ah...

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.220
Ahhh...

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:16.930
Ogami, you're ridiculous.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.740
You set me up.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.580
No, no, no.

00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:21.970
You walked right into it.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.420
This isn't how I pictured it...

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:30.750
Ah...

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.370
I never thought I'd be able
to laugh like this with you.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.730
Never thought?

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.800
We've always been like this.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.180
The "me from this world" has been, sure.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.720
I don't really get it, but...

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.570
I hope I can keep laughing
with you like this forever.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.480
Huh?

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:21.710
Wha... What?

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.040
I want to be with you always.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.680
What you just said...

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.060
what do you mean by that?

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.300
I guess you could say I'm pursuing you.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.290
You can give me your answer later.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.840
Morning.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.370
Good morning.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.580
It's like a dream.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.260
Not only am I close to Ogami,
who I've always admired...

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.670
but there's even a
chance for something more.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.520
If things keep going like this...

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.449
I can finally be on the
same level as Ogami.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.250
You're sales tech.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.210
Your job is to support me.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:22.610
Oh, Ogami.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.780
About the price quote for
Shibaura Construction...

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.080
Oh, the one for the
server expansion, right?

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.400
Did you revise the one I made?

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.650
I did.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.500
That quote was too high.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.060
You should have just said something.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.090
It would've been faster if I did it.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.040
Huh?

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.610
Don't worry about it.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.110
It's fine,

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:47.230
I'm here.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.060
It's all right because you're here...?

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.330
The Ogami from my original world...

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.200
He was always so strict with me...

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.690
This quote is too low.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:23.340
Huh?

00:14:23.341 --> 00:14:25.150
Shouldn't this price be reasonable?

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.349
Whether a price is high or
low isn't for you to decide.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:28.920
The client makes that call.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.830
But he'd always check
it himself in the end.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.990
And tell me what the
problem was face to face.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.829
Revise the quote.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.030
I'm leaving it to you.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.420
Why am I thinking about
the Ogami from that world now?

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.560
Incredible.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:56.030
Tomioka?

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.060
What's up?

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.060
Oh.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:58.670
It's nothing.

00:14:58.671 --> 00:15:01.620
I was prepping materials
for tomorrow's sales meeting.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.670
Ogami-san's sales figures...

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.010
are insane.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.420
He's pulling in twice as
much as everyone else.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.060
No way, it can't be double.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.200
It's not just this month.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.420
Look.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.440
Last month, too.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.730
And the month before that.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.460
How on earth does he do it...?

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.010
Why is it so different
from my original world?

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.410
Did he land some huge deal recently?

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.240
Not really.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.050
He's just been running a ton of accounts.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.920
Just the number of accounts...

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:59.150
Besides, doesn't Ogami-san
just love you, Kano-san?

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.150
Huh?

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.330
He's got you all to himself, Kano-san.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:07.330
All to himself?

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.170
Well, think about it.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.589
Whenever he has a
meeting with you, Kano-san,

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.520
things seem to go a
lot smoother, don't they?

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.050
You're a salesperson with
a tech background, after all.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.920
The Ogami from that world...

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.870
never took me to meetings.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.370
Ogami-san mentioned it too.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.080
He said, "With Kano around, closing
deals is so much faster. He's a huge help."

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:30.680
Could it be...

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.310
The Ogami from my world
didn't take me because...

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.480
You're a salesman now.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.740
Not in tech.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.190
He acknowledged me as a salesperson?

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.250
So, the "me" in this world...

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.050
for all the contracts so far...

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.270
has attended all the meetings with Ogami.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.740
In my original world,

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.170
usually,

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:18.480
I'd go with Ogami for
the first client meeting,

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.680
but after that, I was on my own.

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.060
In other words,

00:17:27.061 --> 00:17:29.580
was he intentionally letting
me handle things on my own?

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.250
Huh? Kano.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.470
You haven't gone home yet?

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.360
Oh... I had a few things to finish up.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:40.260
I was about to ask you the same thing.

00:17:40.261 --> 00:17:42.060
Iwase, didn't you already leave?

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.550
Well, I just...

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.820
I forgot my house keys at the office.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.070
Now where did I put them?

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.920
Huh?

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:53.760
Why do you look so happy?

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.990
Ah, you can tell?

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.460
The thing is, I just...

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.610
came from seeing my girlfriend.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.330
And she gave me this!

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.340
Hey, is that...

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.659
It's a rare, store-exclusive
chocolate, apparently.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.350
You have to wait in line to get it.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:15.870
Here, have one.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.600
Man, I...

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.010
I feel so loved.

00:19:04.796 --> 00:19:05.796
Just as I thought...

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.890
It's the same chocolate
Ogami gave me that day.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.600
Why?

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.180
You'll be fine.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.300
Here, for you.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.030
It's chocolate.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.860
You like it, right?

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.880
Don't you keep a bunch at your desk?

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.840
Back then...

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.780
If he went out of his way to come see me
just to cheer me up...

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.520
Don't try to carry everything on your own.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.060
You'll run yourself into
the ground at this rate.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.060
He's so strict.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.330
And not exactly friendly.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.550
I thought he had already given up on me.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.110
But...

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.610
The person who always believed in me...

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:52.540
You're a salesman now.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.620
Not in tech.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.400
Was the Ogami from that world.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.370
I don't want to go on without ever
seeing the Ogami from that world again.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.680
If it's possible...

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:42.360
Let me become the person
who can properly face Ogami.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:13.890
Kano!

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.110
Kano!

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.460
Ogami...?

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:22.590
Are you all right?

00:22:23.216 --> 00:22:24.216
What happened...?

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.060
What?

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.499
I saw you walk into the
shrine this late at night.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.286
I was worried something
might happen, so I followed you.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:32.510
What's going on?

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.550
Um... which one?

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:45.470
Which one?

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.640
No.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.960
Sorry.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:54.730
Um...

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:56.250
Yeah.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.320
I'm fine.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:59.030
Huh?

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:20.010
Don't tell me...

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.690
Are you so drunk you can barely stand?

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.010
If you can't walk, call a cab home.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:32.720
That cold attitude...

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.420
Is this the Ogami from this world?

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.800
This world?

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.930
I'm back.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.156
(Next Episode)
It's all right.

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:47.970
([Real World] Ogami's Kindness)
You can do it.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:48.720
(Akihito realizes...)
What is this...?

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:49.810
Strawberry milk.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:52.090
So clumsy, yet so kind.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:52.900
(Akihito realizes his
feelings for Ogami, but...)

00:23:52.901 --> 00:23:54.060
This is just unfair.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:55.950
I've finally realized how I feel.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.840
But there's no way I could ever tell him.
