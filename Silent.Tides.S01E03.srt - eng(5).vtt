00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.000
[Episode 3]

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.670
[Hong Kong, December 24, 1941]

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.420
Xian,

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.650
could you not go tomorrow?

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.630
With so much to handle
at home right now,

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.530
could you skip going to Huilong tomorrow

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.810
and help me pack instead?

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.280
If our whole family
really moves to Macau,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.390
we won't know anyone there,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.020
and every little thing will cost money.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.090
You have to think about Father
and the children too.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.079
Besides,

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.210
Huilong's withdrawal has been open
for half a month already.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.040
Most who were able to withdraw their money
have already done so.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.590
There's just that one last person left.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.050
How can you be sure
they'll show up tomorrow?

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.150
Look at how chaotic Hong Kong has become…

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.480
people are dying, and others are fleeing.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.020
What if…

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.350
what if that person
has already left Hong Kong.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.340
But what if

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.230
that person hasn't?

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.320
By the way, Yinwan,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.579
let me talk to you
about something serious.

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:20.930
Hmm?

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.700
Tomorrow, don't go to the orphanage.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.829
Pack your luggage in advance instead.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:25.950
So urgent?

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.740
Yes.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.280
Didn't the British Governor say

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.410
Hong Kong could hold out for
at least another six months?

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.170
It won't be six months—

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.170
I'd say

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.829
just a day or two at most.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.560
That fast?

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.930
That's exactly why we need
to prepare early.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.640
Once there's a ceasefire,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.710
the transport links
between Hong Kong and Macau

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.420
are sure to be among the first to reopen.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.280
Then, we can go to Macau together.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.000
Let's not talk about this anymore.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.730
After all, it's Christmas Eve.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.140
We can leave these troubles for tomorrow.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.240
Hey,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.260
how about I play you a tune?

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.790
Do you want to listen?

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.300
Moonlight shines

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.810
on the threshing floor.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.400
Little one...

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.680
Renyu!

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.070
Moonlight shines

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.329
on the threshing floor.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.430
Little one, be good and go to sleep.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.720
Tomorrow Mom has rice shoots
to plant so deep,

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:39.770
and Granddad takes the buffalo
up the hill to keep.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.180
What did you say?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.620
You've mixed up in a smuggling affair.

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.960
It's nothing.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.300
I just wanted to make some extra money.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.370
[William Jones, Royal Navy Lieutenant]

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.720
If I had known that Huang Gongjie

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.130
was crazy enough to smuggle tungsten ore,

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.300
[Mary Jones,
Wife of Lieutenant William Jones]

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.570
I would never have done it.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.000
Now it's too late to cover it.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.260
The Governor has already
started the full investigation.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.000
Tungsten ore?

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.620
Is it... that important?

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.980
It's a kind of rare and critical
strategic material for a country's war.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.870
It is used to make warships,

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.150
tanks, armored vehicles,
and armor-piercing shells,

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.300
and every nation expected it.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.360
What?

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.190
A key strategic resource,

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.830
and you let it fall into the hands
of the Japanese.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.440
William,

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.060
t-that's treason.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.670
I know, I know, I...

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.730
I know, I know, I...

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.950
I only work with Yang Chang.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.100
I didn't expect the situation

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.310
to become this messy.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.140
Yang Chang?

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.890
Is that

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.750
the Chinese sergeant
who keeps coming to our house?

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.120
No wonder he kept bringing you envelopes.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.650
So that was the bribe money—

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.930
to keep the operation quiet.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.830
Listen, it's okay, alright?

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.230
This is not a problem.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.630
I just need your help now.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.540
Colonel Lyons is the one
running this investigation.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.409
He's also your cousin, right?

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.370
I need you to put in a good word
on my behalf.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.800
Just convince Lyons

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.390
to put the blame on Yang Chang,

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.390
nothing else.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.570
He's a Chinese.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.300
The case wouldn't be affected.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.660
Never imagined my husband

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.990
would be involved in something so sordid.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.000
Mary, listen.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.810
Do you have any idea
how much a lieutenant earns?

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.700
Do you think I can afford
all of this? I can't.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.330
I'm under so much pressure.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.060
I'm honored to be married
to a noble lady like you.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.070
I did this for our family,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.800
for us.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.040
Please.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.420
I'm begging you.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.120
Speak to the Colonel.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.800
He would help me if you do.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.870
My dear, you're an angel.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.690
Once I am safe,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.950
I will help him.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.010
I promise.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.200
Is that enough?

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.100
[Stanley Prison, Hong Kong]

Sir,

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.070
please, I beg you—

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.590
can you take a message?

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.870
I need to see Lieutenant William.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.360
You damned traitor,
smuggling for the Japanese!

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.420
And you still have the breath to yell?

You're doing well.

Profits are for Mr. Huang.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.570
We're just the errand boys.

No!

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.630
Understood, sir.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.540
Come on, it's just some undeclared goods.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.700
The penalty won't be that bad
if you're caught.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.120
I'll speak to William.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.690

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.970
Can you help me pack the clothes
into the luggage?

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:34.890

Please come in.

[Mr. Quiver,
Chief Manager of HSBC Hongkong]

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.070
Jose, what is it?

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.440
Mr. Quiver,

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.060
those items in the vault

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.060
must be getting rid of immediately.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.810
Otherwise, HSBC
will make an unforgivable mistake,

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.540
and we'll all go down
in history as criminals.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:09.520
Jose,

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.660
I don't get it.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.090
Why are you so anxious?

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.560
Those Hong Kong dollars
and printing plates are safe.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.230
This is Hong Kong,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.940
the crown jewel of the British Empire
in the East,

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.640
and it will always belong
to the British Empire.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.590
So in just the past two weeks,

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.020
the British Empire

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.540
has lost New Territories and Kowloon.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.180
With just the tiny island
of Hong Kong left,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.710
how long do you think
the British Empire can hold out?

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.440
The Royal Army is invincible.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.500
The British Empire is not like China.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.540
Those reddish-head Japanese...

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.680
They might be bullying the Chinese.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.680
What do you think?

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.700
I'm Chinese too.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:50.280
Dear Jose,

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.660
I didn't mean you.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.680
I never considered you
as some ordinary Chinese.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.520
You're my dear friend.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.020
Mr. Quiver,

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.830
I'm Chinese.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.940
It's fair if you want
to ignore my advice.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.230
It's fine if you want
to stay here with HSBC

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.230
and with those two financial time booms.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:20.730
And it's fine if you want to cling
to your faith in imperial invincibility.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.280
But I'm done with it.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:23.810
I quit.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:25.990
Jose!

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.810
Xian, have you done packing?

Qiwen.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.680
It's alright.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.020
Just be safe

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.530
and come back soon.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:54.420
Thank you.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.900
Jose,

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.150
wait a minute.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.680
I'm sorry.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.230
You were right.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.160
What do you mean?

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.520
Governor Sir Mark Young just called.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.160
The government has decided
to surrender to the Japanese army.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.140
We have to take preventive measures

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.330
before they take over the bank.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.540
How much time do we have left?

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.660
The agreed signing time is 6 p.m.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.880
Jose, please.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:30.560
I was wrong before.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.590
But now HSBC needs you.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.070
Please.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.040
Stay,

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.800
even if just to handle

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.230
the transfer of the goods.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.970
Please.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.300
Hello?

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:44.590
Renyu.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:47.520
What did you say?

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.970
Surrender?

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.760
I don't have time to explain now.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.190
You—pack your things,

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:52.970
get ready,

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.310
and ask around
about any boats in the area.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.560
Get to Macau at the earliest opportunity.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.660
Mary, listen.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.390
Pack all our valuables at home.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.470
Hurry.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.470
T-The British is surrendering, alright?

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.350
Hong Kong is doomed.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:04.880
W-What about you?

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.920
There are still two things at the bank
I must take care of.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.760
How can you still care about the bank

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.060
at a time like this?

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.970
It's not that I want to delay.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.780
These two shipments are critical—

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.800
I must secure them.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.170
If the Japanese get them,
it'll be a disaster.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.380
We have six or seven hours

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.940
until the ceasefire.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.160
Now go and pack.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:20.800
Be good.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.160
W-What about you?

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.850
I'll meet you later

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.400
after I finish the mission at the port.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.280
Just leave.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.470
Okay.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.130
Wait! William, hold on.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:34.880
What?

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.070
If we're leaving,

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.760
then what about Yang Chang?

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.670
Yang Chang?

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.900
The Chinese man
who took your place in prison.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:42.350
You promised me

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:43.310
you'd get him out.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.300
How can you still think

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.630
of Yang Chang right now?

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.230
William, he took the fall for you.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.680
You can't just abandon him.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.060
Besides, it is no small affair

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.260
and we'll get asked questions
when we get back to England.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.080
You can't just leave him
rotting in there forever.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.760
Alright. Thanks for reminding me.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.560
I promise, no worries.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.450
I will get him out of prison.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.640
I swear.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.090
Okay.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.730
Mummy...

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.190
Sweetheart,
I know you don't want to leave it.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.810
But I promise

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.860
we'll get a new one, alright?

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.400
Hey, look,

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.970
I don't like wearing this.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.130
When we get home tonight,

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.470
I'll pick some flowers

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.900
and make you a flower crown.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.570
It'll be much prettier than this,
I promise.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:26.850
Really?

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:27.710
Really!

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:28.610
I promise.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:30.800
Be careful.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.950
Don't let it snag your hair.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:32.470
Hmm.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.440
Good kids.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.680
Who is it?

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.090
It's Qiu.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:55.880
It's Qiu.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.560
Don't worry, no one followed me.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:00.990
Mr. Huang.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.720
How did it go?

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.140
Haggled with Fearless Biao for ages.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.470
Finally got it settled.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:06.780
Once the ceasefire in Hong Kong starts,

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.990
he'll take us to Macau on his speedboat—

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.040
the one he uses for his opium runs.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.590
Only thing is, his price
is a real rip-off.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.050
He's asking for this much.

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:13.540
A hundred? That's not bad.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:14.570
A hundred what?

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:15.370
Ten thousand!

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.190
Ten thousand?

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.110
The bloody nerve!

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.160
Who does this Fearless Biao think he is?

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:19.940
He's nothing but

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.110
a two-bit pimp

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:22.400
and opium pusher!

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:22.690
Exactly.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.290
Mr. Huang,

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:24.190
he used to be ready

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.680
to lick your boots!

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.060
And now he's charging this?

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.400
How dare he?

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.160
Times have changed.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:32.280
I'm no longer

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.880
the Second Helmsman
of the Tai Ho Brotherhood.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.400
And now the Brotherhood

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.470
has put a kill-on-sight order

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:39.210
out on all of us.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.420
We're lucky Fearless Biao

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.920
is even willing to take us.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.020
And right now,

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.590
we wouldn't dare

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.680
trust anyone else's boat.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.900
Mr. Huang,

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.900
I got some important news this time.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.090
The bank where you keep your money—
Huilong Bank—

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:00.420
is operating normally,

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.560
and withdrawals are still allowed.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.160
Mr. Huang,

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.510
this is what they call

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.910
"heaven never seals off all exits."

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:09.440
But there's a catch—

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.640
today's the last day.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.010
Let's go!

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:12.470
Let's go, Mr. Huang.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.880
Come back here!

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.740
Come back here!

Today's the last day.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.099

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.210

to get the money out.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.680

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:42.990

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.050
I-Is that any way to talk to Mr. Huang?

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.250

Why did you bring these convicts?

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.290
Who else could I entrust

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.530
such a dangerous mission to,
except for them?

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.360
But they're civilians.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.160
It's the responsibility of the bank

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.860
and the navy to transport these supplies.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.920

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:38.950
Good luck surviving—

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.950
I'm catching a boat to Macau.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.130
You can all rot here!

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.300
Stop right there!

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.650
Aren't you afraid all that noise
will bring the Japanese soldiers running?

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:57.920
You said it yourself—

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.270
Japanese soldiers are all over Hong Kong.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:02.880
We can't escape anyway.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.340
So I'll shout.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:06.440
I'll shout as loud as I can,

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.570
and bring every Japanese soldier here.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:09.760
When they arrive

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:10.400
and find

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.150
a former

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:13.480
British Marine Police sergeant here too,

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.880
do you think they'll arrest you or not?

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.740
Are you insane?

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:20.590
Mary!

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:21.840
You damn bitch,

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:29.040
have you lost your mind?

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.010
That's right.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:34.390
Quite possibly.

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:40.050
If we die,

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:42.980
we die together.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.970
No one gets out alive!

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.180
What the hell do you want from me?

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:14.740
Didn't you just say
you're taking a boat to Macau?

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.380
Take us with you!

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.700
Why on earth should I take you to Macau?

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:26.800
Can you really stand by

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.030
and let those beasts gun us down?

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:44.860
-Daddy!
-Daddy!

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.610
-Xian, you're finally back.
-Daddy!

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:47.760
Do you realize

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.050
how late it is?

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.060
The whole family's been worried sick.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.090
I'm sorry,

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.740
I tried to get back sooner,

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:55.440
but there were

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.130
Japanese checkpoints blocking
so many roads along the way.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.660
I had to circle around forever
to make it home.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.810
What's all this?

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:05.380
We agreed

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:06.820
we'd leave for Macau

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.550
once the war ceases, didn't we?

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:09.900
I've been asking around all evening,

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:10.670
and the neighbors said

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:14.000
there are already boats to Macau
leaving from Tsim Sha Tsui.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:14.820
Really?

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:15.280
Hmm.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:16.610
We don't know how many boats there are

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:17.800
or whether

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.900
we can get on,

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.670
but many neighbors are going
to try their luck.

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.150
We should go too and see.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:27.360
Xian,

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:28.840
what's wrong?

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.610
The last depositor

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:32.500
came to withdraw his money.

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.110
The last depositor?

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:37.150
The 30,000-something dollars left
in our family savings…

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:38.680
it was a depositor's money.

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:40.420
Now that he has taken it…

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:41.990
we…

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.770
have no money left to go to Macau.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.340
Not a single one was captured?

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:52.830
Affirmative, sir.

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:54.550
We raided the addresses

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:55.880
of all Chinese targets.

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:57.250
They had all vanished.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.490
Clearly,

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:00.700
a coordinated protection operation
was carried out.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.530
Additionally, several hours ago,

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:05.700
multiple officers escaped
from the British military barracks.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.650
The exact number and ranks
are still being verified.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:10.880
Report!

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.840
Enter.

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.590
Unidentified vessels have appeared
near the beach in Tsim Sha Tsui.

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:21.850
Many Hong Kong citizens are gathering
along the shore, attempting to board.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.030
No wonder the targets vanished.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.990
Seal the coastline immediately!

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:32.060
Do not let them escape!

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:32.950
Yes, sir!

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:38.150
Don't blame yourself too much

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:39.450
about the withdrawal.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.150
About the money—

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:42.320
look,

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.420
I sold some things

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.170
from the house today,

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:46.490
and some jewelry too.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.440
We have 470 dollars now.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.240
That should cover the boat tickets,
shouldn't it?

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:55.800
I understand your worries.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.170
It's about having no money, right?

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:00.780
Back then,

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:02.630
you started as an apprentice

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.340
at the age of 13,

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.800
went into business on your own at 16.

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.260
With no capital,

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.150
I scraped

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:13.950
together 200 dollars to get you started.

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:16.020
You peddled oils and grains

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.510
street by street,

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:20.800
worked as a middleman,

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:21.770
earned every bit

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:23.380
through hard work.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:24.840
And later,

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:26.720
we opened our own bank.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.610
We built it up, step by step.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:31.650
At worst,

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.810
we start over from scratch.

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:34.840
Yes,

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:37.070
Father is right.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:39.270
Before, you struggled alone.

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:41.340
Now we have a whole family—

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.360
more hands make lighter work.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.340
As long as we're together,

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.200
there's nothing we can't get through.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:47.780
Hmm.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.870
Mummy's right.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.170
As long as we're together,

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.360
we'll make it work.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.130
Hmm.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:58.840
Alright then.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.260
Let's all go to Macau together—

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:02.880
our whole family—

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:04.880
and carve out a new future!
