You can't just delay the delivery like
this. It's causing a lot of problems for us.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.670
I'm so sorry.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.190
Seriously.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.780
Telling us it'll be a week
late on the original due date?

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.450
Isn't that something you
should've told us sooner?

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.040
I am truly sorry.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.070
This is my responsibility.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.010
Don't apologize, Kano.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.940
It's my fault. This happened
because I left it to you.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.030
I...

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.910
What's wrong?

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.030
You look so down.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.040
Don't worry.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.670
Kano.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.710
I for sure know...

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.640
everything about you.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.250
Ogami.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.640
It was a dream...

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.950
It's already been a week

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.710
since I've come to this world.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.780
Even though this world
is different in so many ways...

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.290
Whoa...

(How to Be an Outstanding Salesperson)

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.980
The me from this world
bought this book too.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.280
But in other ways... it's exactly the same.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.060
Okay.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.130
Sorry I'm late.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.400
Oh, it's fine.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.870
Did something happen?

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.590
I went to buy some pastries.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.830
You can pick one.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.910
There's one for me?

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.360
I bought extra.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.810
Let's eat them on the bullet train later.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.840
Thank you.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.790
Alright.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.230
Let's get going.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.800
A business trip with just the two of us.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.469
If this were the Ogami from my world,

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.870
I'd be totally miserable right now.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.810
They're all dessert buns...

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.490
But with this Ogami,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.440
it's so much more relaxing.

"Love Begins in the World of If"
(Episode 3)

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.569
Okay, I'm counting on you to
do your part as we discussed.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.960
Yeah, I'll handle the product description.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.700
I'm counting on you.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.500
I'm fully prepared, too.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.040
I hope I can show Ogami my good side.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.520
As you can see, this
system is highly accessible.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.480
It won't interrupt your business
operations, so you can rest assured.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.510
I see.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.979
It's easily customizable with low-code.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.670
And it's very user-friendly.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.609
That's impressive.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.810
You explained it very clearly.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.380
Thank you.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.929
Well then, I'll send you the price quote.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.410
Please take your time to consider it.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.529
This would be really
convenient for us to use.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.530
It would.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:51.890
Excellent.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.980
Their reaction was good.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.580
We'll be in your care then.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.090
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.210
Miyoshi-san.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.930
What's that stain on your cuff?

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.360
Oh, this?

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.428
It's nothing.

00:05:09.674 --> 00:05:11.876
I just got it dirty working in
the warehouse a minute ago.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.900
How embarrassing.

00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:15.340
You work on the floor
yourself, Miyoshi-san?

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.330
Yeah, there's a lot that
needs to be checked.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.909
It's amazing that you can
handle the fieldwork too.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.620
Oh, come on.

00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:24.480
We're just short-staffed.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.220
We're running around like crazy every day.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.800
Is that so?

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.060
It would be great if you could use some of
that time for product planning, wouldn't it?

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.060
You're telling me.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.609
I saw in an interview on
your company's website...

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.306
that you wanted to
strengthen your private brand.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.490
I believe that's what I read.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.990
- Wow! You even read that?
- Yes.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.200
Of course.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.579
Well... if you don't mind...

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.600
would you like a tour of the factory later?

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.080
- Really?
- Of course.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.289
- Then yes, I'd love that.
- Ah.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.290
Let's go then.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.590
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.780
Great work.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.270
Great work, everyone.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.379
When you're constantly
bogged down by operations...

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.480
it's hard to stay motivated, isn't it?

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.189
You're absolutely right.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.589
We're buried in
confirmation tasks every day.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.219
In that case, if you pair the
management system from before...

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.969
with another one of our support systems,

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.570
you could save a
significant amount of time.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.580
Really?

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.339
Yes. And by increasing your efficiency,

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.840
you'll have more time for
what you really want to do.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.190
Most of all, I'm looking forward
to your new brand, Miyoshi-san.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.330
Ogami-san.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.270
Our philosophy...

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.570
is to hopefully move forward
together with our clients.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.260
Right, Kano?

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.070
Oh.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.880
Yes, um...

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.026
I'll include the price quote
for the other system...

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.270
when I send it over.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.220
Thank you.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.320
Oh, right. Since you're here,

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.080
why don't we have dinner tonight?

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.840
That's wonderful. I'd love to.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.829
I'll make a reservation then.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.930
Thank you.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.380
Then we gratefully accept.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.336
I'll have some of our
younger guys join us, too.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.726
- Great, the more the merrier.
- Let's have some fun tonight.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.950
We're in your hands.

(How to Be an Outstanding Salesperson
by Takeda Yuhei, CEO of Seishin Holdings)

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.800
Thanks.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.700
Here.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.360
You're amazing, Ogami.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:29.780
What do you mean?

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.940
You hit it off with them instantly.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.789
You didn't just sell the management system,

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.680
you managed to upsell
them on another product.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.660
I only sold it because I
genuinely think they need it.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.730
By saving time,
Miyoshi-san can do what he wants to do.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.680
And that will be better for his company.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.340
You really think things through.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.750
Well, that's what a salesperson's job is.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.490
I could never do that.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.000
Why are you so down?

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.730
It's only your first year.
You've still got a lot to learn.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:14.990
But...

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.680
But you're studying hard, aren't you?

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.770
You read that book, too.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.400
No.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:22.750
No, that's not... um...

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.000
I just bought it because I
thought it might be useful...

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.120
I've bought it, too.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.840
- Huh?
- That same book.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.960
You did, Ogami?

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.010
You mean you've read such an elementary
book?

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.250
Is there a problem with that?

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:38.860
But...

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.170
You don't seem like you'd need it.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.350
That's not true.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.069
When I first started at the company,

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.720
I was always getting chewed
out by upper management and clients.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.700
Really?

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.310
Yeah.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.939
I didn't know what to do back then.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.970
So I bought that book on a whim.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.760
It covers all the basics of sales.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.040
And the print is big, so it's easy to read.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.300
I never would've imagined...

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.680
Really?

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.380
I always thought you were the
type who's perfect at everything.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.580
No one's like that.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.100
Everyone starts at the same place.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:21.890
I see...

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.190
So the Ogami I see today is
the result of all your hard work.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:27.450
Of course.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.559
You've been working hard too,

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.050
which is why you're doing so well in sales.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.470
I'm not doing well at all.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.720
Huh? What?

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.270
Don't sell yourself short.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.390
Huh?

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.440
You were forced to transfer, but you didn't
give up. You've been working so hard.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.340
That's incredible.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.390
Those words.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.620
I'm so glad we could close this deal.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.380
Thanks to you.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.700
Thank you so much for today.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.360
You've been a huge help.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.890
We look forward to working with you.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.426
I always... wanted to
hear him say that to me.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.270
Let's find another time to pitch to them.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.250
- Okay.
- I'll keep an eye out.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.510
I'm counting on you.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:29.890
Thanks.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.030
The work's not over yet.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.210
We still have that dinner with the client.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.910
A client dinner...

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.390
What's with that sour face?

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.939
It's just that, when I was
in the tech department,

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.310
I hardly ever went out
for drinks with anyone.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.566
To be honest, I'm not a
big fan of those situations...

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:52.300
While the tech guys are figuring out
how to write elegant code,

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.570
we're at the dinner table
gathering client needs.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.306
That's an impressive
job in its own right, isn't it?

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.490
Well, when you put it that way...

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.840
It'll be fine.

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.190
Don't overthink it. Just enjoy yourself.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.730
Alright, maybe I'll give it a shot.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.220
What's wrong with having a dream?

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.680
Miyoshi-san is right.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.860
Oh! You get it, Ogami-san.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.689
I get that it's never too late to start.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.410
We're really on the same page.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:39.780
Here, here. Drink up, drink up.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.180
- Well, don't mind if I do.
- Right, Tsuchiya-san?

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.370
Right? Kano-san.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.410
Yes.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.550
Come on, another toast.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.830
A toast, a toast!

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.550
Let's all toast together. Cheers!

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.620
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:57.070
Excuse me.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:11:59.260
Knowing how to have fun...

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.420
is really difficult for me...

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.450
Excuse me, Kano-san.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.283
Miyoshi-san can get a
little carried away sometimes.

00:12:06.308 --> 00:12:07.430
Oh, not at all.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.400
I think he's just happy to talk with
someone who shares his passion.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.684
Ogami-san is a really
good person, isn't he?

00:12:15.155 --> 00:12:15.956
Yeah, he is.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:18.350
He really is...

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Kitagawa-san.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.650
Here, use this.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.160
Huh?

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.130
You looked cold.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:31.390
I'll talk to the staff in a bit

00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:32.880
and ask them to turn up the heat.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.850
Thank you.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.970
It's hard to know what to
wear these days, isn't it?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.430
Yeah, it has gotten a bit chilly.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.890
How is it compared to Tokyo?

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.050
Tokyo's probably a little warmer.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.690
I see.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:50.770
I'm so jealous.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.760
Tsuchiya-san.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.470
Is there anything you don't eat?

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.020
- Oh... Sorry! I'll get it!
- It's fine, I'm closer.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:00.660
My apologies.

00:13:00.685 --> 00:13:01.385
Thank you.

00:13:01.545 --> 00:13:03.670
That's Ogami-san for
you. Always so thoughtful.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.900
- It's hot, so be careful.
- Thanks.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.920
He's good at his job,

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.260
and he's considerate of others.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.340
What are you two doing?
Want me to set you up?

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.110
No wonder he's so popular.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:20.950
Anyway,

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.050
I don't really care if Ogami is popular.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.360
Kano-san, are you okay?

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.580
Hm?

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.030
- Should I get you some water?
- Oh... No, I'm fine. It's just...

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:33.850
I'm really sorry.

00:13:33.851 --> 00:13:35.250
- I'm really okay.
- Really?

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.380
Yeah.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.300
Oh, it's getting late.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.180
I'll call a taxi.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.019
- Sorry for keeping you out so late.
- No, no, thank you for handling it.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.020
Not at all.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.140
Huh?

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.000
Is that a Fluffy Bear?

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.160
Huh?

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:57.670
You know about them?

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.740
Yeah, they're really popular with kids.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.130
Yeah, exactly.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.879
My best friend's kid is obsessed with them.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.420
- That's why I have it.
- Uh-huh.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.050
Oh.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.070
Does that mean...

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.050
Kano-san, do you have kids?

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.530
Oh, no.

00:14:09.531 --> 00:14:12.229
- Um... My niece likes them.
- Oh.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.470
Oh, I see.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.090
You just seemed to know a lot about them.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.570
I thought you might be married.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.490
- No, I'm not even seeing anyone.
- I see.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.120
No, actually...

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.520
This bear...

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.520
Hm?

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.740
Ah... I'm exhausted.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.500
(Sorry, running a little late.
(Wanna grab another drink in my room?)

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:03.740
Ah...

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.520
I wasn't sure what you liked,
so I bought a bit of everything.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.600
This should last us until morning.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.710
Ah...

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.380
I'm dead tired.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.070
Yeah.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.000
Miyoshi-san just wouldn't stop talking.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.420
But thanks to him,
they really opened up to us.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.030
Looks like they'll be a
regular client from now on.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.190
I see.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.229
If it had just been me,

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.350
I'm not sure I could have
landed the contract at all.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.590
What are you talking about?

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.609
It was your sincere explanation
that laid the groundwork.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.100
That's why they trusted us.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.660
Didn't I say it earlier?

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.060
Don't sell yourself short.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.160
Somehow,

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.260
I feel like you're spoiling me.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.320
You think so?

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:04.670
Yeah, I do.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.020
The Ogami from my original world
would never be like this.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:12.710
Well,

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.230
you did ask for my help before.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.450
What do you mean?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Don't you remember?

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.980
Back when you first
joined the sales department,

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.840
didn't you take on the tech department's
work too and end up missing a deadline?

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.920
Oh...

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.970
That incident...

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.940
I insisted on doing it all myself,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.570
but I couldn't finish in time.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:43.829
It was all my fault.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.660
I made you go apologize
to the client alone, Ogami.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.850
But you were trying so hard back then.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:52.650
Huh?

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.660
When you asked for my help,

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.010
you said it when you
apologized to me right after that.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.170
Oh, I apologized...?

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.180
After bowing and apologizing to the client.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.180
I'm so sorry things turned
out this way... Ogami.

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:08.850
It's alright.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:10.650
I share some of the blame.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:12.930
Thank you.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.600
I still don't know anything about sales.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:18.230
So...

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.020
could you teach me,
starting from the basics?

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:26.980
Please, help me.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.110
You also went to our colleagues in sales.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.520
You asked them to teach
you what you didn't know.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.499
You were hard to approach at first,

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.740
but that's when you started to get along
with everyone in the sales department.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.209
I really admired you for that.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.090
I thought you were an honest, good guy.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.460
An honest, good guy...

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.080
The me from back then...

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.490
Why are you apologizing, Ogami?

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.820
It's clearly my fault...

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:05.710
No.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.800
It's my fault. I'm the one
who gave you the work.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.100
I'm used to apologizing.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.850
If you mess up again in the future,

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.090
I'll go apologize with you.

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.010
I never asked you to do that.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.760
How could I make you do that?

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.240
I see.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:39.850
I understand.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:46.890
What's wrong?

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.280
Nothing.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.590
I was just thinking about how that's the
reason why everyone is so nice to me.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.820
You say that like it has
nothing to do with you.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.940
This world...

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.080
This is great, Tomioka.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.860
- With such a reliable sales engineer here.
- Right!

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.040
I'm really counting on you, Kano-san.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.070
Hey, Kano.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.270
Let's go for a drink today.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:26.220
I thought this was just an "ideal
world where everyone is nice to me."

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:28.610
But...

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.620
this world...

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:38.840
is a world that branched off from the
"me who could honestly ask for help."

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.260
Is it really okay for me to stay here?

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:46.890
Hm?

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:48.830
Oh, nothing.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.740
Oh, right.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:57.659
We're taking an early
bullet train tomorrow.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.780
Shouldn't we go look for some souvenirs to
bring back?

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.130
Souvenirs...

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.240
I don't really have anyone to give them to.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:06.850
I see.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.050
I'd like to go search for a little bit.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.190
Buying for someone?

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.510
Yeah.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.820
For who?

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.110
My mom happens to be visiting Tokyo.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.570
Your mom, huh?

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.360
What is it?

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:36.170
Nothing.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.260
I was just wondering if
you live with someone.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.950
I was living with my
girlfriend until a year ago.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.080
But we broke up.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.170
I see...

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.370
She said I wasn't thoughtful enough.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:54.940
That's not true at all.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.280
You're very thoughtful, Ogami.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:08.810
You think so?

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.090
Thanks.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.800
How long have you been single, Kano?

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.090
Huh?

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.380
Sorry.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.760
I couldn't help but overhear
you back at the restaurant.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.220
Oh.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.210
I had a long-term girlfriend in college.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.579
But we broke up while we
were job hunting after graduating.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:35.990
I've been single ever since.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.130
Why'd you break up?

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.690
She was moving away for a job.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.320
She said she couldn't do a
long-distance relationship.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.400
I see.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.080
Her loss.

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.230
She let a great catch get away.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.900
Alright.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.580
It's about time for bed.

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:18.690
Well then.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.050
Don't you like sweets?

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.540
Alright then.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.120
Good night.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.680
My body's so hot.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:30.830
All this time,

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.390
I've been trying so
hard not to think about it.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.980
But I...

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.180
I really...

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.840
What is this...?

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:46.780
(Next Episode)
These feelings I have for Ogami...

00:23:46.781 --> 00:23:49.506
(The ideal Ogami from the 'If World')
I can't believe I feel this way.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.989
(Torn between the 'If' and 'Real' worlds)
The Ogami from my world was so strict.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:55.580
(Akihito's true feelings)
So why am I thinking about that Ogami now?

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.790
I always wished... we could
just keep laughing together.
