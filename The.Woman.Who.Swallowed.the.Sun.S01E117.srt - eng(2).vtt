00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:03.270
(Episode 117)

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.350
This is a memorandum stating
you'll transfer all of your shares to me.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.180
Sign it.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.350
Are you insane?
You think I'd give you all my shares?

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.290
The death of CEO Han Kyung Soo
of Doeun Industries.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.190
I suppose you don't mind
if the truth about that gets out?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.190
Do you have proof?

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.030
However much you cry and make a scene
about how you've been wronged,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.170
your words alone won't beat me in court!

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.670
I suppose
this is more than enough proof, then?

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.780
(New Technology Transfer
and Usage Rights Security Agreement)

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.890
You think this flimsy,
old piece of agreement is a threat?

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.320
You really don't know how the world works,
do you?

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.230
With enough money,
I can make something like this disappear.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.800
Is this the police?

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.130
There's an intruder in my house...

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.000
What about your handkerchief
with Jo Pil Doo's blood on it?

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.910
- That would change things, wouldn't it?
- What is the emergency, sir?

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.540
Has someone broken into your home?

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.380
Are you being threatened?

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.080
No, it was a mistake.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.820
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.290
Smart move.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.860
Even for the great Chairman Min Doo Sik,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.500
if your past crimes are revealed
to the whole world,

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.370
you won't get away unscathed.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.800
How did you get that?

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.010
You've had it all along,
so why did you wait until now?

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.110
Because that's just who Tae Kyung is.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.680
He intended to punish you legally,
by the book.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.220
And he wanted to give you
a chance to repent first.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.790
So, this was why you approached me.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.690
To take Mingang from me.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.090
Transfer your stake,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.560
and I'll leave all this evidence behind.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.830
Unlike Tae Kyung,
I see things differently.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.990
Lucia.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.270
Answer me one thing honestly.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.540
Did you never love me? Not even once?

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.080
After all the time we spent together,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.280
did you really never love me,
not even for a moment?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.290
Never.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.450
Not even once.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.830
Why, that little... How could she...

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.730
Darn it!

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.440
That witch!

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.210
You!

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.540
I'll make you pay for this!

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.080
You!

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.010
You!

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.890
- Chairman!
- Father!

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.160
Are you all right?

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.360
Chairman!

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.530
Chairman? Your mouth...

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.300
What are you talking about, Manager Gong?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.340
Why would Father's mouth become paralyzed?

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.670
He went into shock
after that woman stopped by.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.110
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.840
Are you saying that woman
came to the house?

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.440
What in the world could she have said
to make him like that?

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.780
I don't know.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.350
You need to get here fast.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.120
I'm terrified something awful will happen
to him if he stays like this.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.120
All right, I'm on my way now.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.690
(Mingang Distribution)

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.330
Where are you going?

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.560
Apparently, Father's mouth
became paralyzed from shock.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.160
What? But why, all of a sudden?

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.870
It happened right after Lucia visited.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.370
I can't imagine
what she could have said to him.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.900
Really?

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.570
Anyway, I need to get home.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.050
What happened?

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.990
I told you everything on the phone.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.860
So Father became like that
because of that woman?

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.060
Yes.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.130
Wait.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.870
Don't be too shocked.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.450
Get out.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.520
- Father.
- I said, get out!

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.030
You should have taken him
to the hospital...

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.960
or called a doctor to the house.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.570
Chairman Min said he didn't want anyone
to see him like this.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.370
You have to take him
to the hospital anyway.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.280
Yes.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.350
I'm telling you,
his mouth is all paralyzed.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.790
What are you talking about?
Why would that woman come to our house?

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.160
She made a huge scene and stormed out.
That should have been the end of it.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.400
What gives her the nerve
to come crawling back?

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.800
I know, right?

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.240
I've never seen anyone so shameless.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.070
So Father was so shocked by her
that his mouth ended up like that?

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.570
How bad is it?

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.510
You have to see it for yourself.
So get home early.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.420
I wonder just how paralyzed his mouth is.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.990
This much? Or this much?

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.690
Here it is.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.460
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.100
You think it serves me right, don't you?

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.440
You must be gloating, right?

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.910
- How can you say that?
- You love to see me suffer, don't you?

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.040
I understand what you're going through,

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.350
but you shouldn't
take your anger out on me.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.280
What did I tell you?

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.690
I told you she was bad news.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.790
That she's a woman
with no sincerity or integrity.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.090
I told you to be careful
and to stay away from her.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.860
And every time, you were the one
going on about "destiny" and all that.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.400
You ignored us when we were against it,

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.130
and you insisted on this marriage.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.240
Father, here.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.990
Don't you have any idea
why that woman is doing this?

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.660
Even if she had ulterior motives,

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.630
this is all too sudden, isn't it?

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.530
I think...

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.440
it's because of that jerk, Moon Tae Kyung.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:49.970
So, using that agreement as bait,

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.880
you managed
to get all of Chairman Min's stake?

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.680
I'm just coming from a meeting
with my lawyer.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.920
There's still some red tape,
but it will all be sorted out soon,

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.350
and then I can exercise my rights
as a shareholder right away.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.920
So you'll really be
the largest shareholder...

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.360
of Mingang Distribution.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.530
Now the real work begins.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.900
I'll first call a board meeting
or a shareholders' meeting...

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.300
and become the chairman
of Mingang Distribution.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.240
That family is going
to put up a huge fight.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.070
Do you think it'll be possible?

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.270
I have to make it possible.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.840
Only by officially becoming
the chairman...

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.510
can I finally break this chain
of bad fate.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.720
Those two were together from the start.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.120
She married me while she was in love
with another man.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.790
When I went after him, she threw a fit,
terrified something would happen to him.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.760
Then that's for the best.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.100
We can use that to accuse her of an affair
and kick her out with nothing.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.470
If only it were that simple...

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.540
That's not all.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.340
You mean there's more?

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.150
I stole it from Moon Tae Kyung's father
30 years ago.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.160
I got rid of his parents back then.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.430
I made it look like a car accident.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.170
It was a no-name company that got lucky
and developed some new technology.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.100
I invested a ton of money
to commercialize it,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.640
but instead of being grateful,

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.370
he came after me
to get revenge for his father.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.380
Lucia used it to blackmail me.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.620
She said she'd use it as evidence
in court.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:40.650
So that means...

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.890
she intends to have you punished, Father.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.590
But how did you get it back?

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.800
But...

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:54.930
Is this the original?

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.230
Se Ri.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.030
Mom!

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.760
I was so worried.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.600
Why haven't you been answering my calls?

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.570
I was going to find you at work.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.640
Do you have a minute?

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.470
Of course.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.020
I'm sure you heard from the family.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.220
Why did you do that?

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.660
Are you mad at Dad about something?

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.900
But how could you
just leave home like that?

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.630
You are not going to...

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.500
divorce Dad, are you?

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.140
Se Ri.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.910
Listen to me very carefully.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.650
From now on,

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.390
I'm going to be fighting
against your family.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.060
It's going to be hard for you to watch.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.960
So, if you're okay with it,

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.760
would you like to come stay with me?

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:37.940
With you?

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.500
Yes.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.210
But to do that,

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.780
you'd have to leave home too.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.820
If it's hard to answer right now,
I can give you some time.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.290
But you have to give me an answer
the next time we meet.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.840
(New Technology Transfer
and Usage Rights Security Agreement)

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.710
I have it right here in my hands,

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.910
so how did she trade it
with the company stake?

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.920
Madam Jang. How did you find me here?

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.960
What do you mean? Lucia told me.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.190
She said you were beaten up badly.
You look awful.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.630
You must be here for a reason.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.570
I'm curious.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.270
Have you had a change of heart?

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.270
I really hope you and Lucia
can get along again as you used to.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.810
She's going through a lot right now.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:55.610
Goodness.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.520
Even in your condition,
all you do is worry about Lucia.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.320
You're serious about her, aren't you?

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.590
Madam Jang.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.390
All right, fine.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.390
You win.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.000
When you were kidnapped, Lucia came to me.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.630
She asked me to help find you.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.200
But I didn't do a thing.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.040
I guess I was just being stubborn,
trying to pretend it wasn't my fault.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.710
You know how old people are stubborn?
I never thought I was like that, but I am.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.340
I guess I'm just past my prime.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.780
So, does this mean we're all okay now?
All of us?

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.780
Yes. So, if you need a place to stay,

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.420
don't go looking around
for some strange place.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.150
The two of you should come to my hotel.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.890
I'll make sure nothing this awful
happens to you again.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.530
Thank you, Madam Jang.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:14:01.080
(Iin Forensic Document Examination Center)

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.010
I've finished the analysis.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.080
So, is it authentic?

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.920
It's a forgery.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.860
It's very sophisticated and precise,
so most people...

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.290
would find it difficult
to tell that it's a fake.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.380
What do you think you're doing,
barging in without knocking?

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.490
What about what you did?

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.320
You think you can fool my father
with a cheap fake like this?

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.060
How dare a woman like you
toy with Chairman Min Doo Sik?

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.960
And you thought I'd just hand over
the real one?

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.400
I can't do that. Not when so many people
died unfairly for this.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.100
It was just their time to go.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.570
The world doesn't change
just because a few nobodies disappear.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:04.880
No need to make such a big deal about it.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.780
People like them don't change the world.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.620
The elites, like us,
are the ones who change it.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.160
They were all honest, good-hearted people.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.790
They would've lived modestly
within their means...

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.760
if you hadn't hurt them.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.830
People who knew what true happiness was,
even when things were tough.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.470
You should know it's entrepreneurs like us
who put food on their tables.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.900
And you have the nerve to complain
instead of being grateful?

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.370
You're beyond help.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.510
- Like father, like daughter.
- Shut it.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.110
Get me the real agreement now.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.210
Or else I'll make you pay.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.450
I'm afraid I can't do that.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.020
You see, in exchange for this,
I was given the chairman's entire stake.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:52.260
What?

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.360
My father's stake?

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.330
Did you think I'd make a deal for nothing?

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.730
If you don't believe me,
go ahead and check.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.400
(Mingang Distribution)

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.600
What?

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.240
Where did she go?

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.510
Hey, Lawyer Park.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.220
What did you say?

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.620
You're saying Chairman Min's stake
has been transferred to Jung Lucia?

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:27.560
When? Is the transfer legally complete?

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.460
When does it take effect?

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.100
Got it.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.700
What on earth?

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.710
So that means the largest shareholder
of Mingang Distribution...

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.240
is now Lucia.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.850
So you used this fake agreement
to steal my father's stake, is that it?

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.190
Steal? He signed the documents
with his own two hands.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.320
You tricked him into it!

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:04.330
If you don't return the stake right now,
I swear I might actually kill you.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.100
So if you want to live,
give back my father's stake now.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.040
The nerve of you, thinking you could be
Mingang's largest shareholder.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.300
That's absurd.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.640
Do you people think
human lives are disposable?

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.240
You think you can just get rid of anyone
if they get on your nerves?

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.280
How dare you threaten to kill me!

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:24.280
- Give back the stake now.
- No, I'll never give it to you.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.250
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.960
- Let go!
- You let go!

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.100
- Let go of me!
- I said, let go!

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.970
- Let go!
- Give back his stake!

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.540
You let go first!

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.710
Let go of this! I said, let go!

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:53.740
Hey! What's going on with you two?

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.580
Ji Seop, call the police on her right now.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.580
She tricked Father with a fake agreement
and stole all his stake.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.890
What are you talking about?
Why would Father's stake go to that woman?

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.260
She conned him with a fake agreement.
Who wouldn't have fallen for that?

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.490
What are you waiting for?
I said, call the police now!

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.100
Perfect. I have a few things
to report myself.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.770
Why don't we all go down to the station
and sort this out in front of the police?

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.080
We can discuss trading
a fake agreement for his stake...

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.980
and Chairman Min Doo Sik's past crimes.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.880
- Let's see whose crime is worse.
- What is she talking about now?

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.620
What does she mean
by Father's past crimes?

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.530
You should go back to your office.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.630
Take her with you.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.860
Just calm down for now. Let's go.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.670
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.550
Is all of this true?

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.410
Did you really use a fake agreement...

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.780
to swindle Chairman Min Doo Sik
out of his stake?

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.120
So it's okay when you all do it,
but it's not okay when I do?

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.260
Baek Sul Hee, you've finally gone too far.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.070
(Mingang Distribution)

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:24.670
Hey.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.870
Did that woman really
take all of Father's stake?

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.070
Why else would I be this upset?

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:31.880
Why, that woman...

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.180
She wreaked havoc at home...

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.010
and infuriated me.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.580
Today,

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.580
I'm going to teach her a lesson
as the representative of Mingang.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.450
I was waiting for an excuse to get her.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:44.890
Ji Seop!

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.220
That's not the problem right now.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.560
We have to get Father's stake
back from her first!

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.160
But how did she get her hands
on it in the first place?

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.670
Did Father really give it to her
just to get her off his back?

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.640
You know what? Let's just go hear it
from Father himself. Come on.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.080
Hey. Get up. We have to go home right now.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.720
- Why are we going home all of a sudden?
- To Lucia,

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.050
Father gave his entire stake.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:18.890
What are you talking about?

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.030
Oh, my.
What brings everyone here at this hour?

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.710
Father, what in the world is going...

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.210
What? What's with the mask?

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.810
Oh, right. My wife told me.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.880
Is it true
that your mouth became paralyzed?

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.810
What are you talking about now?

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.320
Anyway, is what Ji Seop said true?

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.150
He said you gifted your stake
to that woman.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.290
Gift? It was more like extortion.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.290
Go on, tell them.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.260
Tell them what it's like to be
duped by a fake agreement.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.800
A fake agreement?

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.500
That agreement is a fake.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.500
It's a forgery she cooked up
to steal your stake, Father.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.410
I can't believe
you fell for a woman like that.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.840
Are you out of your mind?

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.440
Are you happy now
that you've given away your whole stake?

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.780
You always cursed us for causing trouble.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.420
You said you couldn't stand any of us.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.990
You said only Lucia understood you,
didn't you?

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.920
You said that she was the only person
in the world you could trust!

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.090
You really got stabbed in the back
by the one you trusted.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.460
You should have just had actual dementia
back then.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.370
At least then we'd have legal options,
but now there's nothing.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.570
That woman...

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:40.940
is now the largest shareholder
of our company.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.240
She can replace all the executives
if she wants.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.210
Why did you let things get to this point?

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:48.250
Just why?

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.480
So?

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.150
Your father-in-law's young wife,
who left home, came back,

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.520
and your father-in-law's mouth
became paralyzed?

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:02.190
Yes, exactly!
Imagine how furious he must have been.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.790
I never thought
I'd see something like that.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.930
What's he going to do about his mouth?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Why? Is it that bad?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.470
Don't even ask. It was so bad
that I had to get him a mask.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.640
But why would his wife suddenly do that?

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.240
Do you think she has a younger man?

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.380
Maybe living with the old chairman
made her miss being with a younger guy?

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.450
I don't know. I'm not so sure about that.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.420
But Director Moon Tae Kyung's name
did come up.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.720
Moon Tae Kyung?
That's the guy renting that room from us.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.460
So the chairman's young wife
and our tenant are getting cozy?

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:37.160
- Come on! No way.
- Stranger things have happened.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.300
It's just like the soap opera I wrote.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.100
I think I'm psychic.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.730
I should set up a shop
as a fortune teller.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.970
Ja Kyung, you brat.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.810
You're going to be
the wife of the next chairman.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.510
Yang Mal Sook isn't long for this world.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.240
- She'll be dead in three years.
- Hey! You're unbelievable.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.710
Tae Kyung hasn't been back in days.
Where is he? What's he up to?

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.320
Wait, you mean he ran away from home too?

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.450
Wait a minute.
You don't think those two...

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.920
are seeing each other, do you?

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.760
They're together!

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.260
They're together, and it's heating up!
It's getting steamy.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:15.030
I can't even watch! It's too steamy!

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.000
Madam Jang was here?

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.440
Yes.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.770
She said if we have nowhere to go,
we're always welcome.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.580
I'm so relieved she's come around.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.650
I've been worried this whole time.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.250
Speaking of which,
I think I can get discharged tomorrow.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.250
What do you say?

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.820
Absolutely not.
The doctor said you need to rest.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.490
But I'm really okay.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.390
Lying in bed all day is making me antsy,
and I feel like my energy is draining.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.000
And most importantly,

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.160
it weighs on my conscience...

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.570
that you used a fake agreement
to fool someone because of me.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.700
It's not because of you, Tae Kyung.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.510
It's my trump card
for protecting the people I hold dear.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.510
The people you hold dear?

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.440
When you were assaulted by those men...

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.750
and lying unconscious on the street,

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.580
I was terrified
because it made me think of my Mi So.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.550
Watching over you
while you were unconscious,

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.760
I prayed for you to wake up.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.560
I didn't care what happened to me,
as long as you were okay.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.160
I prayed for you
just like I did for my Mi So.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.030
Is that how you felt watching over me?

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.740
I do whatever it takes
to protect my people.

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.880
I can't bear to lose someone
I hold dear again.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.920
Here, take a sedative
and try to get some sleep.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.790
How am I supposed to sleep
when my father just made this huge mess?

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.030
That woman
won't pull something right away.

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:50.490
Not if she has an ounce of decency.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.500
That woman is far more reckless
than I thought.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.770
She acts like she's invincible now,
and it’s honestly ridiculous.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.340
She's going to ruin my father,
Mingang, and the Min family...

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.070
and make us shed tears of blood.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.380
You don't think she'd do that, right?
Especially with Se Ri around.

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:08.610
What does Se Ri have to do with it?

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:10.150
I mean...

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:11.180
It's nothing.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.690
Her doting on Se Ri was all just an act,
a hypocritical ploy.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.490
She didn't mean any of it.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.160
A woman like her would never.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.800
Se Ri, would you be able
to cover a few more hours today?

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:37.610
Ji Hye said something came up at home.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.840
Really? For how long?

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.280
About three hours?

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.820
You'll be getting off late,
so have someone come pick you up.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.190
What am I, a child?

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:53.290
You know how it is out there these days.
It's dangerous even for a grown woman.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.290
Besides, I noticed the streetlight
out front is broken.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.030
(Se Ri)

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.070
The person you called is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.970
(Kyung Chae)

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.480
The person you called is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:51.010
You will be charged after the tone.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.920
Kyung Chae. It's Se Ri.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.850
I'm going to be a bit late tonight.
I'm covering a shift for a coworker.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.020
Would you be able to
come pick me up later?

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.830
I was going to ask our stepmom,

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.030
but things are kind of weird
with her right now.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.770
I'll be waiting in front of the cafe
in about three hours.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.090
What? Did she not get my voicemail?

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.620
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:58.310
