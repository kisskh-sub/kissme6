[Episode 38]

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.800
There's one month left

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.360
to the half-year bet

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.830
you made with Mr. Gu.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.120
I said you will head over

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.050
after the seventh day of mourning.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.000
Is Gu Pingyuan ready

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.259
to give up what he owes?

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.080
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.490
Say something.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.310
Young Master.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.310
I have failed you.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.180
Impossible!

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.200
Absolutely impossible!

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.500
I invested so much money!

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.390
Two hundred shops!

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.829
I should have crushed him easily!

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.280
Young Master, it was not quite 200—

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.700
it was 188 shops.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.470
Counting wages and rent,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.710
we've been losing money.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.150
No one would open

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.430
-two salt shops in each town.
-That's none of your business!

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.940
I'll bear the losses.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.570
The losses are mine.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.560
But the profit

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.290
must have exceeded his, right?

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.600
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.329
Young Master.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.920
Mr. Gu made an unexpected move.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.750
He opened

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.240
231 shops.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.710
For Guangdong, Guangxi, Shanxi,
and Shaanxi,

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.240
he used canal transport and horse caravans

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.400
to transport salt
from Changlu's salt farms,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.240
well salt from Sichuan,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.240
and salt from Lianghuai

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.450
to be sold there.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.020
The profits are enormous.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.770
He cannot win.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.910
He cannot win.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.560
This isn't right.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.630
This isn't right.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.150
He's openly defying

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.630
the imperial court's salt administration.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.320

You're really something.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.960
How did you manage this?

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.800
We found a route

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.630
from Sichuan that allows us

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.000
to transport salt here.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.520
The Changlu salt region

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.960
has been peaceful for many years.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.630
Their salt reserves are abundant

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.690
and prices are low.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.300
As for the salt regions in Shandong,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.710
they can't sell outside the province,

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.560
but the province itself
doesn't consume nearly enough.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.190
But if you look at places like Jiangxi,

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.910
Guangdong and Guangxi,

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.240
and Shanxi and Shaanxi,

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.950
they have insufficient
natural salt reserves

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.120
and have high salt prices.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.579
But their food

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.510
consists mostly of preserved

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.630
and smoked food,

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.360
requiring large amounts of salt.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.700
Since we're opening a salt shop,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.480
why not

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.330
open in these places?

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.820
That makes sense.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.830
The salt licenses from Lianghuai

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.790
also bear the Qing seal.

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.830
Moreover,

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.600
the ban on provincial monopolies

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.730
has been abolished.

As the saying goes,
businessmen should travel the world.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.480
Staying in one province

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.940
is being too restrictive.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.600
I understand now.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.840
Are you taking us

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.970
If Li Wantang can cross the Yangtze River

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.800
to acquire our Lianghuai salt fields,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.630
what's so special

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.830
about what I'm doing?

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.690
If we had thought of this earlier,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.410
why would we have been at odds

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.540
with Li for so long?

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.190
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

This solution

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.470
has been there all along.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.600
If he hadn't pushed me

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.510
to the edge,

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.890
I wouldn't want to deal with him this way.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.040
I don't even want

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.070
to be the Viceroy of Liangjiang anymore.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.110
Sir.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.270
If you're done looking at it,

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.470
please let me go home.

My family is still in mourning.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.650
How could you be like this?

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.690
It's fine, it's fine.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.830
If not now,

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.960
I'll go back with you

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.040
to pay respects to Old Madam Gu.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.920
What could she possibly say about me?

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.520
You're just taking advantage
of my abilities.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.690
Is Gu in there?

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.560
All the filial sons in the world

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.720
are reporting here.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.050
Young Master Li,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.630
weren't you going to come
only after the seventh day of mourning?

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.120
Sir,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.530
I'm here to check the accounts.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.800
Sure.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.590
Go ahead.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.980
Take your time.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.370
You stay right here.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.310
Guards!

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.480
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.830
Guard the door carefully.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.290
Sharpen your blades well.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.690
No one can leave today.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.690
They can leave,

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.830
but not alive.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.030
Yes, sir!

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.159
Your idea

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.600
is excellent.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.870
Some days ago,

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:54.240
I also submitted
a memorial to the imperial court

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.970
requesting to build railways.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.120
Once goods can circulate freely,

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.560
and merchants can trade everywhere,

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.290
our people will become wealthy

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.520
and commoners will live better lives.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.550
The imperial court is planning to establish
a Ministry of Commerce.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.710
I think

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.800
the Minister of Commerce...

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.120
Sir, if you continue this talk,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.160
I'll bash my head
against the wall right now.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.430
Being such a minor official

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.140
has already exhausted me

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.360
to the point of vomiting and diarrhea.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.430
And now you want me
to go serve as an official in the capital?

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.030
You might as well kill me now.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.260
Didn't we agree

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.560
that once I help you
accomplish this matter,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.360
you would let me return to Anhui?

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:29.990
How can you...

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.950
How can you have no ambition

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:32.870
at all?

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.870
This regime

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.330
is not one for business.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.760
We're different from foreigners.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.210
That's insightful.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.070
To be honest with you,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.950
I've been telling the imperial court
the same thing.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.510
I said we can't keep clinging to

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.190
Mencius's old doctrines anymore.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.550
Always going on about

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:58.920
righteousness versus profit,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.720
and gentlemen versus petty men.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.720
People are doing business with us

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.480
holding guns

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.580
and cannons.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.120
Yet here we are, still talking to them

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.070
about Confucius and Mencius foolishly.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.730
Do you think this makes sense?

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.000
The Minister of Commerce

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.350
is a high-ranking official.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.480
If you're lucky,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.680
in just a few years,

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.980
you'll be my equal.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.600
What's good about

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.360
being in a position like yours?

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.390
Aren't you just worried every day

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.720
about your own fortune?

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.380
I don't have that confidence.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.240
Sir.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.130
I'm just a man with no ambition.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:33.669
No,

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.789
you're not.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.490
Alright, that's for later.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.909
We don't need to discuss it now.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:39.549
However,

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.809
in reorganizing the Salt Industry Guild,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.220
your contribution has been tremendous.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.000
I plan

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.750
to give you 20%

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.510
of the Salt Industry Guild shares.

to monopolize the salt industry

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.310
in Lianghuai,

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:11.790
you're the governor.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:13.330
You could simply refuse

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.480
But now we're dealing with

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.400
the British.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.400
We need to come up with an explanation.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.920
Yes.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.650
I had someone look into

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.550
the Elements of International Law.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:25.260
A country

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.720
can declare important commodities

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.520
as state monopolies.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.270
I've sent someone with the book

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.750
to ride quickly to the capital

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.330
and deliver it
to the Office of General Management.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.480

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.680

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.960

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.310
What should we do?

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.790
We really screwed up this time.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.760
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.440
You're the Viceroy of Liangjiang,
a high official,

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.350
and you have no ideas.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.350
Yet you ask me to think of something?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.930

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.290

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.160
Sir.

Let me be honest.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.990
This is not

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.530
how merchants should act.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.550
Either you're

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.720

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.780
to pressure others

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.750

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.680

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.680
always backing down.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.960
If you want to do business
with the British,

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.750
this approach

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:27.810
simply won't work.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.480

There you go, Sir.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.750
Thank you.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.880

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.480

He's backed down?

Not surrendering—

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.240
probably just being polite.

This is just the beginning.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.850
He'll get increasingly cooperative.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.480
It's just the beginning.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.030
Surely he will be more and more compliant.

he was playing Taichi with me.

the negotiations didn't go well.

That old man is really good
at dodging issues

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.760
and refuses to admit to anything.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.560
He insists on meeting you in person.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.090
But even if he meets you,

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.240
he will still consult with the Emperor

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.770
and the Empress Dowager.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.440

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.350
already go to the capital

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.400
to see the Emperor and Empress Dowager

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.660
to resolve this issue?

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:29.240

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.350
are even better at stalling.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.420
But they still

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.800
have many ways

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:42.720
to break their promises.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.500
For example, the signing date

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.680
is being postponed indefinitely.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.010
The British Empire now

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.550

with so many people consuming salt.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:16.410
to gain control of only one-fifth

of Qing's salt industry.

You're telling me this isn't profiteering?

this is not a highly profitable industry?

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.230
If I can't resolve it,

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.420
I'll pack my things

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.370
and return to Ningguta myself.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.070
Come, sit.

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:50.560
Tell me

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:51.990
how I should help you.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.590
Whether you agree to his demands or not,

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:55.550
he will come ashore sooner or later.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:57.120
The key to this matter

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:59.270
is that we can't proceed without him.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.680
After he gets off the ship,

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.910
whether you kill him,

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.620
confiscate his property,

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:05.890
or offer him titles and promises,

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:07.640
I think none of it will work.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.489
It's better to just honestly
take responsibility.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.760
I

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:14.409
take responsibility?

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.840
Have you lost your mind?

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:19.840
How about I serve
as the Viceroy of Liangjiang

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.639
for a few days?

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.480
I'll be your proxy
and handle all negotiations.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.679
After it's done, let me return to Anhui.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:28.409
For the rest of my life,

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.620
leave me alone.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.239
For the rest of your life?

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:34.480
That's too long.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.510
Is that a yes or no?

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:39.710
You're the Viceroy of Liangjiang,

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.190
a leader among court officials.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.840
Can't you say something

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.900
that I can believe?

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:50.260
Fine.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.000
If you can make this happen,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.460
you'll have freedom to come and go
in Liangjiang as you please.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.060
Are you tired?

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.370
If you are, go inside and take a nap.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.400
I'm not tired.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.630
It's so rare

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:28.930
to have a meal with you.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.180
Who says so?

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.110
Then I'll come back
to eat every day from now on.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:34.000
Please don't.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.970
If you don't find it annoying,
I certainly do.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.190
Where's Pingwen?

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.980
What's wrong with you lately?

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.000
Didn't Pingwen escort Mother's coffin

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.880
back to Anhui?

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.370
He won't be back to help until next month.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.320
Recently, things

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.960
have been coming one after another.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:58.720
My head is about to explode.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:02.080
It's always been like this.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.370
Yet here you are,
talking about coming home for meals everyday.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:09.510
Li Qin has

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.420
caused a huge mess.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:15.190
He mortgaged the Lianghuai salt fields

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:16.280
to the British.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.920
Now the British have brought

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.980
their gunboats to the Yangtze River.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:22.880
The work at the salt fields

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.810
seems impossible to continue now.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.110
I think we don't need to wait for

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:28.170
Pingwen to return.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.440
We should just go back to Anhui

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.640
and grow tea instead.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.680
Not just the two of us,

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.980
but also the little one in your belly.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:40.190
You're all talk.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:45.570
If there are gunboats on the Yangtze,

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:47.770
shouldn't we find somewhere to hide?

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:49.190
Let them be there.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.920
They won't fight.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.130
It's just that business

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.850
will be difficult from now on.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.030
They keep

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:57.760
bringing their gunboats here.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.120
How can we negotiate?

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.680
It's truly infuriating.

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.710
Mr. Gu.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.710
Yes?

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:05.780

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.510
asking you to meet him at the door.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.770
Why doesn't he come in?

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.730
He insists you meet him at the door.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.090
Who is it with such an attitude?

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.360

a good thing?

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:30.230
