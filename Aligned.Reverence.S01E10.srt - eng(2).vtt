=Episode 10=
(My brother, you are alive.)

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.859
Sorry.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.580
I did not control my strength well.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.219
Just slipped a bit.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.460
As for the temper?

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.980
Qi Sheng flirted first.

00:01:42.475 --> 00:01:43.395
Do you

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.180
really want to go to his manor?

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.909
I only think Heir Qi

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.048
is not as simple as he appears.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.179
Prince Duan's manor
once contended for the throne.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.780
The power behind him must not be small.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.010
If I can gain his trust,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.700
and win his support,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.019
it may help the Xiao family

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.700
stand better in the future.

00:02:06.462 --> 00:02:08.182
I will carry this family.

00:02:08.737 --> 00:02:10.907
You do not need to bow to anyone.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.700
Candied fruits
and candied hawthorn skewers.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.460
Candied hawthorn skewers.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.045
Candied fruits
and candied hawthorn skewers.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.995
Candied hawthorn skewers.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.299
Candied fruits.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.011
Candied hawthorn skewers.

00:02:28.012 --> 00:02:30.292
Xiao Qi keeps asking
for candied fruits lately.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.980
Try some for me.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.539
Xiao Qi is obedient and clever.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.900
Why would she fuss?

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.730
Only because you never see her fuss.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.060
Taste it for me.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.260
Alright.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.060
Not bad. Quite good.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.659
If you like it,

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.340
then Xiao Qi will too.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.540
Give me some more.

00:03:01.937 --> 00:03:03.019
So much?

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.420
Can Xiao Qi finish all that?

00:03:06.362 --> 00:03:07.642
Grandmother says

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.979
girls should be

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.540
raised with care and spoiling.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.180
When I restore the Xiao family one day,

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.579
I will let all of you

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.060
live pampered lives.

00:03:23.687 --> 00:03:25.807
I loved candied fruit when I was little.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.299
But Father always said

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.620
too much ruins the teeth,

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:29.835
so he never let me have any.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.819
I was angry back then.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.699
I swore that when I grew up,

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.419
I would open a sweet shop,

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.099
hire a few handsome boys,

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.900
spend the days running
the business and sipping tea.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.940
You even planned

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.420
to raise handsome boys?

00:03:47.137 --> 00:03:48.257
Thanks.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.445
Good food, good views, good company,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.340
that is a carefree life.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.379
Uncle Su was right.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.140
Sweets should be taken less.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.940
They really do ruin teeth.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.580
Yunxi?

00:05:46.812 --> 00:05:49.407
(Yaoguang Pavilion)

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.260
Who are you really?

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.820
Xie Yunyan, what are you doing?

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.260
Take off your mask.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.620
Take it off!

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.540
What is it?

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.587
You have this kind of habit too?

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.179
See a handsome man on the street

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.660
and you want to grab him?

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.580
You...

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.580
Listen to me.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.380
He is

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.020
under Xinglin Hall's care.

00:07:13.237 --> 00:07:15.237
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:07:16.337 --> 00:07:17.817
I just think

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.500
he looks like someone I once knew.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.060
Someone you knew?

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.459
What now?

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.619
Do you really think

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.220
you are flirting with a lady here?

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.260
What?

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.219
Keep lingering here

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.020
and I will go tell Young Lady Su.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.340
I...

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.740
You

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.139
flirting in the street

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.660
with my man.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.099
You...

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.900
Your man?

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.657
You are simply...

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.860
You are utterly unreasonable.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.882
(Xinglin Hall)

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.540
Speak.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.300
Do you hold a grudge against Xie Yunyan?

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.619
I treated you for over a month.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.420
Your life was snatched back
from the brink by me.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.060
Do not think I do not know.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.060
You have been stalking
the Xiao family in secret.

00:08:53.525 --> 00:08:55.365
Who are you?

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.420
I do not want to save the wrong man.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.220
I am

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.420
the first son of the Xiao family,

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.900
Xiao Yunxi.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.980
Xiao Yunxi?

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.260
Then the one buried
in the Xiao tomb is...

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.780
At that time,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.980
Linchuan suffered a crushing defeat.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.220
I broke through the siege
to seek reinforcements,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.380
but was ambushed on the way.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.020
My deputy wore my armor,

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.300
and we split into two groups

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.060
to cover my escape.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.420
The deputy died later,

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.820
and his body was returned
to the Xiao family.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.940
As for me,

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.380
I was chased to the cliff edge

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.607
and you saved me.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.420
Now that the Xiao family
has finally cleared their name,

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.900
peace has returned.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.060
If I return now,

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.660
it will only bring chaos again.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.020
Besides,

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.407
I am gravely poisoned,

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.060
and I do not have long.

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:26.965
Yunxi,

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.260
do not worry.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.660
I will cure you.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.620
Young Lady Xi, do not force yourself.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.660
Right now,

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.900
I only wish to uncover
the truth behind Linchuan.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:41.860
You...

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.179
Wait,

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.180
you...

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.300
How did you know I am a woman?

00:10:51.875 --> 00:10:53.139
Your courage is admirable.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.140
This matter,

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.180
I will keep secret for you.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.100
No,

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.300
how did you find out?

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.940
You peeked while I was changing?

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.499
Or when I was bathing?

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.580
You...

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.540
Say something.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.540
No need to ask, young lady.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.419
If you refuse to speak,

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.549
you won't sleep tonight.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.095
Say it.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.739
(If that man truly is my brother,)

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.380
(why would he not return?)

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.580
(Could it be that I mistook him?)

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:01.940
Young Master.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.620
Feng Kui was found
near the old temple in the south.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.819
Yan.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.940
You seem restless tonight.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.340
I made ginseng soup for you.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.140
I'm turning in now.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.260
Alright.

00:12:22.337 --> 00:12:23.977
Rest well then.

00:12:24.662 --> 00:12:25.782
Very well.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:45.970
Feng Kui.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.540
Young Master Xiao.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.980
They

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.399
are in Jiangnan,

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.120
selling illicit salt.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.500
What General Xiao seized

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.340
was never grain or silk.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.300
They

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.739
threatened me with my wife

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.980
and child.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:05.780
I...

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.180
I...

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.180
I...

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.380
I failed the General.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.060
