WEBVTT

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:06.878
Gentle-hearted gay man Genichi Hatano

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:07.812
and his crush,

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:10.115
Saku Sakuta,
find themselves growing closer

00:00:10.181 --> 00:00:11.549
under the same roof.

00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:13.351
I support you
in pretending to be her parent.

00:00:13.418 --> 00:00:15.086
The "Parent-Child Contract"
previously made with Hotaru

00:00:15.153 --> 00:00:16.554
now has Saku's name too.

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:17.622
Koito…

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.858
I liked him so much back in middle school.

00:00:20.692 --> 00:00:23.595
Genichi finally puts an end to the regrets
lingering from his first love.

00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:25.430
I bought a house with my partner.

00:00:25.497 --> 00:00:28.166
Maybe the partnership stuff
should come first?

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:29.701
As both of their feelings align,

00:00:29.767 --> 00:00:31.436
they start searching for a home.

00:00:31.503 --> 00:00:34.472
-Are we buying it or not?
-We are. Let's buy it!

00:00:34.973 --> 00:00:37.142
I want to know how you and your partner

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:38.576
bought your home, Koito.

00:00:38.643 --> 00:00:39.978
And the required documents.

00:00:40.912 --> 00:00:41.980
And the required documents

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:43.214
that you needed for the loan.

00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:44.516
Got it!

00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:47.418
I think I kept them all together,
so I’ll look for it later.

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:48.620
Really? Thanks.

00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:51.956
My partner
is looking forward to meeting you.

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:55.527
Wait.

00:00:55.593 --> 00:00:57.095
So you two are dating now?

00:00:57.162 --> 00:00:59.397
Things escalated quickly, huh?

00:00:59.464 --> 00:01:01.599
Ah, yeah. Well…

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.668
Okay, talk to you later. Bye.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.370
How’d it go?

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:07.672
Next time, when we
go over to Koito’s place,

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:09.440
he said he'll show us

00:01:09.507 --> 00:01:10.742
the loan documents and stuff.

00:01:11.876 --> 00:01:14.045
Okay, we can talk about that
when that time comes.

00:01:14.112 --> 00:01:16.548
About the partnership,
we need to make an appointment

00:01:16.614 --> 00:01:18.049
and go to the city office.

00:01:18.116 --> 00:01:19.684
Do you have any off days for work?

00:01:20.985 --> 00:01:23.221
And I’d like to meet your parents too.

00:01:24.556 --> 00:01:25.890
Are you really okay with this?

00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:28.993
-Huh?
-The partnership with me and all that…

00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:31.829
It just makes things easier
when you’re renting a place

00:01:31.896 --> 00:01:34.499
or getting a mortgage.

00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.301
It proves our relationship is legitimate.

00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:38.469
That’s not what I meant.

00:01:41.306 --> 00:01:44.475
-Are you planning for a breakup soon?
-Oh, no.

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:47.045
-I thought you wanted a "clamp".
-Yes, I do.

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.914
-A "clamp" in the form of a house.
-Okay, then.

00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:52.417
Let’s call your parents.

00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:56.020
Sorry I kept it from you.

00:01:56.087 --> 00:01:58.423
That’s everything Tomoe told me.

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:01.025
Isn’t she being super selfish? My mom.

00:02:01.092 --> 00:02:02.260
It's getting on my nerves.

00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:04.796
It's all talk, saying she loves me.

00:02:09.968 --> 00:02:12.737
-What are you doing?
-They expire today.

00:02:12.804 --> 00:02:15.440
They’re safe to eat raw that period.

00:02:15.506 --> 00:02:18.142
If you cook them,
they’ll last a bit longer.

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.877
-What?
-Yeah.

00:02:22.847 --> 00:02:26.684
Whatever, I feel like stress-eating.

00:02:27.986 --> 00:02:29.587
Oh! Two yolks!

00:02:29.654 --> 00:02:32.090
I'm sure something good
is going to happen!

00:02:32.156 --> 00:02:33.324
Because it’s a double yolk?

00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:36.394
Yeah. When you get a double yolk,

00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:39.264
or when you see someone
with a bouquet walking around,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.232
something lucky happens after.

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:44.702
-Right…
-You don’t seem to believe me.

00:02:53.678 --> 00:02:55.179
Perfect!

00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:58.149
Nicely taken.

00:03:03.121 --> 00:03:04.055
Hey,

00:03:04.122 --> 00:03:06.157
you can clock out a bit early today.

00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:08.126
Thank you.

00:03:08.192 --> 00:03:09.260
Is something going on?

00:03:09.327 --> 00:03:11.529
My mom is coming to Tokyo from Hokkaido.

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:14.499
Think of taking care of your parents
as part of your job

00:03:14.565 --> 00:03:16.034
while you and they are still around.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.568
While they are still around?

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:20.338
Even the boar that died

00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:21.472
had way too much energy

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:23.808
and was kind of a nuisance.

00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:25.510
Yeah.

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:27.178
Being alive also means

00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:29.314
you could die anytime.

00:03:41.125 --> 00:03:44.562
-Oh, how lovely!
-What?

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.597
I'm Hatano’s mother.

00:03:46.664 --> 00:03:48.700
Thank you for looking after my son.

00:03:50.635 --> 00:03:52.603
I’m Inokashira, the landlady.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.473
Do you do art?

00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:59.077
It's from quite a long time ago, though.

00:03:59.143 --> 00:04:00.178
May I have a look?

00:04:00.945 --> 00:04:02.580
Oh my.

00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:05.383
It’s interesting.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.885
This kind of… fantasy creature.

00:04:07.952 --> 00:04:08.853
Isn't that right?

00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:12.990
Thank you. Anyway, if you'd excuse me.

00:04:15.927 --> 00:04:17.595
What fantasy?

00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:21.699
You need to knock

00:04:21.766 --> 00:04:24.769
three times, then bow,
and say, "Excuse me."

00:04:24.836 --> 00:04:26.471
MOCK INTERVIEW FOR CLASS 4

00:04:26.537 --> 00:04:28.906
Wait until they tell you to sit.

00:04:28.973 --> 00:04:29.907
Okay.

00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:32.677
-Don't give me "okay".
-Okaaay.

00:04:34.412 --> 00:04:35.380
HOTARU KUSUNOKI

00:04:35.446 --> 00:04:36.614
Here.

00:04:37.281 --> 00:04:39.884
High school brochures
that I think might suit you.

00:04:39.951 --> 00:04:41.919
You really need to decide soon!

00:04:43.588 --> 00:04:46.391
-I’m going to live how I want from now on.
-What?

00:04:46.457 --> 00:04:49.660
Like how my mom collects those keychains.
I’ll do whatever I want too.

00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:52.830
-Such as?
-I’ll figure that out as I go.

00:04:53.464 --> 00:04:56.200
-Huh?
-Well, if you'd excuse me.

00:04:57.402 --> 00:04:58.803
Wait!

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.572
Hatano’s mother is coming today.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.876
What? So, you two are officially together?

00:05:04.942 --> 00:05:07.211
This is like greeting the in-laws, right?

00:05:08.646 --> 00:05:09.647
Uh, well…

00:05:11.048 --> 00:05:11.916
‎I guess so.

00:05:11.983 --> 00:05:13.451
When did you fall for him?

00:05:14.485 --> 00:05:16.354
-Huh?
-What do you like about him?

00:05:16.921 --> 00:05:18.956
I'm the interviewer here, mind you?

00:05:20.758 --> 00:05:21.659
Oh?

00:05:22.293 --> 00:05:25.863
-I wrapped up work early.
-Ah, thank you.

00:05:26.497 --> 00:05:30.001
Your mom’s here, right? Should I hide?

00:05:30.067 --> 00:05:32.336
No, it’s fine.

00:05:32.403 --> 00:05:34.305
Just please don’t make things complicated.

00:05:34.372 --> 00:05:35.373
What do you mean?

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.509
You know, the whole
pretending-to-be-your-dad thing.

00:05:38.576 --> 00:05:40.311
Oh, and the 30 million yen matter.

00:05:41.345 --> 00:05:42.313
Okay.

00:05:43.948 --> 00:05:47.652
Please, I beg you

00:05:47.718 --> 00:05:51.055
Remember those days

00:05:51.122 --> 00:05:51.956
Coming!

00:05:55.126 --> 00:05:56.761
-Welcome back!
-I'm back.

00:05:56.828 --> 00:05:58.362
It’s been a while.

00:05:58.429 --> 00:05:59.897
I could hear you all the way out.

00:06:00.731 --> 00:06:02.633
Nice to meet you. I’m Sakuta.

00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:06.037
You must be the one…

00:06:07.872 --> 00:06:08.873
And she is?

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:17.181
-How does it taste?
-It's great.

00:06:18.883 --> 00:06:21.419
-Do you like it too?
-Yes, very.

00:06:21.486 --> 00:06:24.355
I'm so glad to hear that!

00:06:24.422 --> 00:06:26.891
-Eat as much as you like!
-Aren't you glad?

00:06:27.758 --> 00:06:28.793
I am.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.394
Such wonderful neighbors you have.

00:06:31.596 --> 00:06:32.797
I feel like I'm the daughter here.

00:06:34.065 --> 00:06:35.199
Age-wise, okay?

00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:37.635
Then, from my perspective,

00:06:37.702 --> 00:06:39.337
she's like my granddaughter?

00:06:41.272 --> 00:06:42.473
By the way,

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.042
we’re going to the city office
together, Sakuta and I.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.713
To apply
for the partnership certificate, yes?

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:50.147
You know about it?

00:06:50.214 --> 00:06:52.316
Of course.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.686
Are you two going to live together here?

00:06:55.753 --> 00:06:57.889
We’re thinking about buying a place.

00:06:57.955 --> 00:06:59.357
Yes, together.

00:06:59.423 --> 00:07:01.292
That’s wonderful!

00:07:01.893 --> 00:07:04.195
But what about the property agency?

00:07:04.262 --> 00:07:06.097
Should I come along?

00:07:06.163 --> 00:07:08.099
How old do you think I am?

00:07:08.733 --> 00:07:11.102
Someone Hatano knows
is quite knowledgeable.

00:07:11.168 --> 00:07:13.838
Next time, we’ll visit their place
and learn from them.

00:07:14.972 --> 00:07:16.073
It's Koito.

00:07:17.308 --> 00:07:18.709
Koito?

00:07:18.776 --> 00:07:21.412
Oh! From middle school?

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:22.547
Your friend, yes?

00:07:22.613 --> 00:07:23.915
You remember well.

00:07:23.981 --> 00:07:26.117
-I want to come too.
-What?

00:07:26.183 --> 00:07:29.420
Regarding Sakuta's parents,

00:07:29.487 --> 00:07:31.956
maybe I could meet and greet them once

00:07:32.023 --> 00:07:33.224
was what I was thinking.

00:07:34.025 --> 00:07:36.827
They weren't around since I was born.

00:07:37.562 --> 00:07:38.930
-Is that how it is?
-Yes.

00:07:43.834 --> 00:07:45.570
Though, I get why you'd be curious…

00:07:48.272 --> 00:07:51.309
You really do look like him.

00:07:52.343 --> 00:07:54.111
-What?
-Ko from 3Happy.

00:07:55.012 --> 00:07:56.180
-Who's that?
-Oh, come on!

00:07:56.948 --> 00:07:58.449
It's this I'm talking about!

00:07:58.516 --> 00:08:00.885
Haven’t you heard
of Three Steps to a Happy Ending?

00:08:00.952 --> 00:08:03.321
In short, 3Happy.

00:08:03.888 --> 00:08:05.823
It’s a boys' love manga, actually.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.092
Two guys quit their toxic jobs,

00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:10.428
use their meager severance

00:08:10.494 --> 00:08:12.430
and unemployment money to travel,

00:08:12.496 --> 00:08:14.098
and somehow go from rock bottom

00:08:14.165 --> 00:08:17.301
to totally in love and a happy ending.

00:08:17.935 --> 00:08:19.136
I couldn’t stop swooning!

00:08:21.472 --> 00:08:22.306
‎See?

00:08:22.974 --> 00:08:25.776
This is Ko.
Don’t you think he looks similar?

00:08:25.843 --> 00:08:26.811
Really?

00:08:26.877 --> 00:08:28.045
He does.

00:08:28.112 --> 00:08:30.381
Right? You think so too?

00:08:31.082 --> 00:08:34.051
So, try smiling a little like him.

00:08:34.118 --> 00:08:34.952
Huh?

00:08:41.192 --> 00:08:43.327
You look just like him!

00:08:43.394 --> 00:08:46.263
Oh, whatever shall I do?

00:08:47.064 --> 00:08:50.601
There’s this line I want him to say.

00:08:50.668 --> 00:08:53.738
This is Iwai. There’s a scene
where Iwai and Ko

00:08:53.804 --> 00:08:55.573
hug each other.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.774
See? Over here.

00:08:56.841 --> 00:08:57.508
‎YOU FINALLY SAID IT.

00:08:57.575 --> 00:09:01.679
-So, why don’t you pretend to be Iwai
-What?

00:09:01.746 --> 00:09:03.914
and hug each other here?

00:09:03.981 --> 00:09:05.249
Come on now.

00:09:05.316 --> 00:09:07.385
Don't be shy! Go on.

00:09:07.451 --> 00:09:10.087
-Get a little closer. Snuggle up more!
-We're not doing it.

00:09:10.154 --> 00:09:13.357
What's the harm? You're such a spoilsport.

00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.994
-What?
-Oh? Hotaru.

00:09:17.061 --> 00:09:18.129
Are you interested too?

00:09:19.597 --> 00:09:22.533
Hey, wanna go
to the signing event together?

00:09:23.267 --> 00:09:25.936
-What signing event?
-Ah… So that’s why you came.

00:09:26.003 --> 00:09:28.606
Might as well since I'm here, you know.

00:09:28.673 --> 00:09:29.807
Besides…

00:09:30.608 --> 00:09:32.376
I also had to stop by the hospital.

00:09:33.377 --> 00:09:35.780
-The hospital?
-They say I don't have much time left.

00:09:38.516 --> 00:09:40.418
It seems I’m going to die.

00:09:41.585 --> 00:09:42.620
What?

00:09:42.687 --> 00:09:44.689
I was given a terminal diagnosis.

00:09:44.755 --> 00:09:47.258
I have four months left.

00:09:47.324 --> 00:09:50.227
Well, I’m going to get it checked
at the hospitals here too,

00:09:51.896 --> 00:09:54.598
but the outlook isn't great.

00:09:54.665 --> 00:09:57.802
But hey, you don’t need to worry
about any of that.

00:09:57.868 --> 00:10:00.071
Your dad is around, after all.

00:10:00.137 --> 00:10:00.971
Soon,

00:10:01.038 --> 00:10:04.341
I’ll be moving into a local facility
where my friends are.

00:10:06.444 --> 00:10:07.611
I find it hard to believe.

00:10:09.113 --> 00:10:10.548
Even I'm shocked.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.152
-Is that right?
-Surprisingly calm, huh?

00:10:15.953 --> 00:10:16.987
I am worried, though.

00:10:17.054 --> 00:10:19.190
It’s fine. Don’t worry about me.

00:10:19.256 --> 00:10:20.725
Just leave me be.

00:10:20.791 --> 00:10:22.460
I’d feel bad if you fussed over me.

00:10:25.062 --> 00:10:27.298
I’m not exactly young anymore.

00:10:27.364 --> 00:10:28.299
I'm somewhat…

00:10:29.166 --> 00:10:30.301
prepared for it.

00:10:30.367 --> 00:10:31.502
Oh my!

00:10:32.636 --> 00:10:33.604
How reassuring!

00:10:39.076 --> 00:10:39.610
VOICEMAIL SERVICE

00:10:39.677 --> 00:10:41.812
No new messages.

00:10:43.848 --> 00:10:45.950
Shouldn't you be staying with her?

00:10:48.285 --> 00:10:50.554
She told me to leave her be.

00:10:51.055 --> 00:10:52.723
She’s a stubborn one.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.025
Once she proposes something,
she won’t listen.

00:10:55.826 --> 00:10:56.827
Ah…

00:10:57.695 --> 00:10:58.629
Only "ah" from you?

00:10:59.196 --> 00:11:01.565
I was thinking "like mother, like son".

00:11:01.632 --> 00:11:03.667
Shine

00:11:03.734 --> 00:11:07.938
We shall shine together

00:11:08.005 --> 00:11:10.474
I think so too.

00:11:11.575 --> 00:11:13.444
-Did she always like it?
-What?

00:11:14.044 --> 00:11:16.547
Did your mom always like
boys' love manga, that is.

00:11:16.614 --> 00:11:18.983
Oh, no. I was surprised.

00:11:19.049 --> 00:11:20.351
Romance between guys…

00:11:20.417 --> 00:11:21.919
I thought she couldn’t handle it.

00:11:21.986 --> 00:11:23.053
Really?

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.955
When I was 20,

00:11:25.022 --> 00:11:26.490
I told my mom about my sexuality.

00:11:27.324 --> 00:11:29.527
She cried.

00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:32.229
She looked so distressed…

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:33.898
so it was a surprise.

00:11:33.964 --> 00:11:36.167
Well, manga isn’t reality.

00:11:36.233 --> 00:11:37.067
Yeah.

00:11:40.037 --> 00:11:42.606
I'm done filling the forms.
Partnership certificate,

00:11:42.673 --> 00:11:45.543
confirmation form, card application…

00:11:45.609 --> 00:11:46.443
Wait.

00:11:47.611 --> 00:11:48.579
What's this?

00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:51.549
It's for including a child’s name
if we have one.

00:11:54.118 --> 00:11:56.353
Are you considering Hotaru?

00:11:57.822 --> 00:11:58.656
Yes…

00:12:00.891 --> 00:12:02.827
If Hotaru hadn’t been a part of this,

00:12:02.893 --> 00:12:03.828
I'm sure

00:12:03.894 --> 00:12:05.462
none of this would have happened.

00:12:07.064 --> 00:12:07.898
Yes.

00:12:11.035 --> 00:12:12.903
Ah, hey!

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.840
Stop it, Chan! Ah, Chasu…

00:12:15.906 --> 00:12:17.441
Don't do that.

00:12:17.508 --> 00:12:18.976
‎Come on…

00:12:19.877 --> 00:12:21.545
-Hello?
-Sorry for calling so late.

00:12:21.612 --> 00:12:22.847
Is something up?

00:12:22.913 --> 00:12:24.348
This Saturday…

00:12:24.415 --> 00:12:26.450
That pizza place you told me about.

00:12:27.151 --> 00:12:28.519
Wanna go there together?

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.454
Calm down, guys.

00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:32.456
I’ve been kind of busy lately.

00:12:33.357 --> 00:12:35.526
Got it. Alright, maybe another time then.

00:12:36.293 --> 00:12:37.228
Okay.

00:12:38.195 --> 00:12:39.129
U-Um--

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.034
Calm down, buddy!

00:12:44.702 --> 00:12:47.104
-What are you doing?
-Sorry, can you help…

00:12:47.171 --> 00:12:49.306
-Careful…
-Take this.

00:12:49.373 --> 00:12:50.841
Hey, now!

00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:52.142
-Slowly now…
-Oof.

00:12:52.209 --> 00:12:53.444
Okay!

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.712
Everything is alright now.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.282
HOKKAIDO SOUVENIR

00:12:58.349 --> 00:13:00.284
Okay, now.

00:13:03.821 --> 00:13:05.489
Don’t make things complicated, okay?

00:13:05.556 --> 00:13:07.124
Koito’s partner will be there too.

00:13:07.191 --> 00:13:08.626
I know!

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.729
-Welcome!
-Thanks for having us.

00:13:11.795 --> 00:13:13.097
-Please come in!
-Okay.

00:13:13.163 --> 00:13:14.331
Nice to meet you.

00:13:15.099 --> 00:13:17.868
This is my partner, Ryogo Yagura.

00:13:17.935 --> 00:13:20.204
And this is Hatano, Sakuta,

00:13:20.271 --> 00:13:21.939
and Hotaru Kusunoki.

00:13:22.006 --> 00:13:23.841
Thank you for inviting us.

00:13:23.908 --> 00:13:25.309
Here, if you'd like.

00:13:25.976 --> 00:13:28.312
Thank you! I’ll make some tea.

00:13:28.379 --> 00:13:29.480
Thank you.

00:13:29.546 --> 00:13:31.582
Please feel free to make yourself at home.

00:13:31.649 --> 00:13:32.983
Is there anything I can help with?

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.853
Oh, don't worry about it!
The kitchen is messy.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.754
Sorry.

00:13:37.488 --> 00:13:38.856
Have a drink if you'd like.

00:13:40.858 --> 00:13:43.060
-It's a nice place.
-I know, right?

00:13:43.127 --> 00:13:44.361
We stretched ourselves hard.

00:13:44.428 --> 00:13:46.297
Places are crazy expensive these days, no?

00:13:46.363 --> 00:13:49.767
But when you consider the future,
you'd want one, right?

00:13:49.833 --> 00:13:51.635
Especially for people like us.

00:13:53.337 --> 00:13:56.340
And this. For the loan,

00:13:56.407 --> 00:13:58.475
you'd need the partnership certificate…

00:13:58.542 --> 00:14:00.511
We’re going to the city office soon.

00:14:00.577 --> 00:14:02.546
-Oh, prior?
-Yeah.

00:14:02.613 --> 00:14:05.149
That makes explaining
various things easier.

00:14:05.215 --> 00:14:06.583
Sounds good.

00:14:07.217 --> 00:14:09.186
And this is the notarized contract.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.021
What's that?

00:14:11.088 --> 00:14:12.423
It’s like a super contract

00:14:12.489 --> 00:14:14.959
that protects our future.

00:14:15.025 --> 00:14:17.161
Have it drafted by a legal professional

00:14:17.227 --> 00:14:18.529
and file it at the city office.

00:14:18.595 --> 00:14:20.297
It's going to cost time, effort,

00:14:20.364 --> 00:14:21.899
and quite a sum of money, though.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.469
This document here says

00:14:25.536 --> 00:14:27.137
we can live together as a family.

00:14:27.204 --> 00:14:30.074
And here, it says if something happens
to either of us,

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.277
the other can take care
of living arrangements and property.

00:14:33.344 --> 00:14:36.747
Without this, if one of you
were to pass away,

00:14:36.814 --> 00:14:39.350
you can’t leave your property or assets
to the other person.

00:14:40.184 --> 00:14:42.519
Marriage would make this unnecessary.

00:14:42.586 --> 00:14:44.421
That’s really important, huh?

00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:46.290
Party A and Party B

00:14:46.357 --> 00:14:48.692
are considered equivalent
to a de facto married couple

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:50.060
living in a shared household.

00:14:50.127 --> 00:14:52.830
-Kinda sounds like something I wrote once.
-What?

00:14:53.864 --> 00:14:54.898
It's nothing.

00:14:56.667 --> 00:14:59.336
"Article 5, Living Rules."

00:14:59.403 --> 00:15:02.539
You can also write rules
the both of you have agreed on together.

00:15:02.606 --> 00:15:03.774
I see…

00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:07.978
"Until both Party A and Party B
have finished bathing,

00:15:08.045 --> 00:15:10.080
neither parties may use the futon."

00:15:10.147 --> 00:15:11.749
Oh, I see how it is with you guys…

00:15:13.283 --> 00:15:16.754
"Party B may not use
more than half of the eggs

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.290
in the refrigerator

00:15:20.357 --> 00:15:21.258
to make hard-boiled eggs?"

00:15:21.825 --> 00:15:22.626
I don't get it.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.996
I’m party A, this person is party B.

00:15:26.063 --> 00:15:28.032
I’d go out and buy a pack of eggs.

00:15:28.098 --> 00:15:28.966
The one with ten.

00:15:29.033 --> 00:15:31.435
And this person turns them all
into boiled eggs.

00:15:31.502 --> 00:15:32.469
Without asking!

00:15:34.905 --> 00:15:38.042
Boiled eggs are the best for working out,

00:15:38.108 --> 00:15:39.843
and they keep you full and all that.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.512
But, you know,

00:15:41.578 --> 00:15:43.247
some days I want a fried egg,

00:15:43.313 --> 00:15:46.383
or egg on rice, or a rolled omelet,

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.352
eggs benedict, an omelet,

00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:50.120
or even poached eggs…

00:15:50.187 --> 00:15:51.922
If you had to eat boiled eggs every day,

00:15:51.989 --> 00:15:53.957
wouldn't you get sick of it?
Don't you agree?

00:15:57.361 --> 00:15:59.830
-Somewhat.
-Even this morning, right?

00:16:00.597 --> 00:16:03.367
I thought I’d make a fried egg,
so I cracked one open, but it was boiled.

00:16:03.434 --> 00:16:04.268
All of them!

00:16:05.936 --> 00:16:08.839
So that was why the kitchen sink
was covered in eggshells…

00:16:08.906 --> 00:16:09.773
What do you think?

00:16:10.808 --> 00:16:11.975
Since you guys are here,

00:16:12.042 --> 00:16:14.311
I want to get a third-party opinion.

00:16:15.045 --> 00:16:16.780
-What opinion?
-Well, you see…

00:16:17.781 --> 00:16:20.717
the "half" rule was kind of vague.

00:16:20.784 --> 00:16:23.420
Sometimes you don’t use
any eggs at all, Ryogo.

00:16:23.487 --> 00:16:24.988
And when I made many boiled eggs,

00:16:25.489 --> 00:16:27.091
there were times you didn't say anything…

00:16:27.624 --> 00:16:30.627
Just because I was silent, does that mean
it’s okay to break our promise?

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.666
What matters more? Me or the boiled eggs?

00:16:41.605 --> 00:16:42.840
Both.

00:16:46.777 --> 00:16:49.713
Ask whatever you need from him here on.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:50.981
Sorry about this.

00:16:51.048 --> 00:16:52.483
-What?
-No way.

00:16:52.549 --> 00:16:53.383
Really?

00:16:55.385 --> 00:16:57.054
You should chase after him, Koito.

00:16:57.688 --> 00:16:59.556
-Huh?
-Quick!

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.793
-Will they be okay?
-They'll be fine.

00:17:03.293 --> 00:17:04.194
Ah, he caught up.

00:17:05.696 --> 00:17:07.731
‎I can buy more eggs
‎if that's what you want.

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:16.507
I hope everything’s okay.

00:17:18.408 --> 00:17:21.011
‎CHAN
‎CHASU

00:17:21.078 --> 00:17:24.281
HOKKAIDO SOUVENIR

00:17:29.253 --> 00:17:30.954
Looking for a nice place?

00:17:31.021 --> 00:17:32.723
NICE PROPERTIES AVAILABLE!

00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:34.558
Find me and this little guy a place,

00:17:35.325 --> 00:17:37.828
a place where things feel right,

00:17:37.895 --> 00:17:40.230
a place where I can be reborn
as a better person.

00:17:40.297 --> 00:17:42.900
-Understood.
-Do such places exist?

00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:45.669
Whether you believe me or not…

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:47.638
that’s up to you, sir.

00:17:49.206 --> 00:17:51.008
That was a joke, really.

00:17:51.074 --> 00:17:53.143
There’s no way I’d believe that!

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.318
Ah! It's a tortoise!

00:18:01.385 --> 00:18:04.121
I don't think so.
It's definitely a turtle!

00:18:04.188 --> 00:18:05.088
It's a tortoise.

00:18:05.155 --> 00:18:06.990
It's a turtle, for sure!

00:18:14.031 --> 00:18:15.465
A bird's legs…

00:18:16.667 --> 00:18:17.935
Two, huh?

00:18:18.869 --> 00:18:22.439
I wonder if a house
really can act as a "clamp"?

00:18:22.506 --> 00:18:24.308
They’ll make up quickly, I’m sure.

00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:26.543
You think so?

00:18:29.746 --> 00:18:31.114
I'm back.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:33.784
What?

00:18:35.786 --> 00:18:36.887
Huh?

00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:38.889
Where's Dora?

00:18:40.557 --> 00:18:42.492
Even at this hospital…

00:18:43.227 --> 00:18:44.728
It seems I really have…

00:18:45.395 --> 00:18:47.798
until March!

00:18:47.864 --> 00:18:49.499
Oh dear…

00:18:49.566 --> 00:18:51.768
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

00:18:51.835 --> 00:18:53.136
-Hello!
-Um!

00:18:54.538 --> 00:18:56.340
What do you think this looks like?

00:18:56.406 --> 00:18:58.709
Cute little flamingos!

00:19:07.951 --> 00:19:10.854
Welcome back. Have you seen the tortoise?

00:19:10.921 --> 00:19:12.389
What tortoise?

00:19:12.456 --> 00:19:14.625
It seems to have gone missing
from Hatano’s place.

00:19:14.691 --> 00:19:15.826
Oh my!

00:19:18.662 --> 00:19:19.529
Found it?

00:19:19.596 --> 00:19:21.665
I searched that area already,
but it isn't there.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.902
-Found it?
-No.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.639
I see. Same here.

00:19:29.606 --> 00:19:32.009
If you see a double-yolk egg…

00:19:32.676 --> 00:19:35.612
or see someone with a bouquet,

00:19:35.679 --> 00:19:37.447
good things happen.

00:19:38.015 --> 00:19:40.617
-What's that about?
-The landlady told me that.

00:19:41.451 --> 00:19:44.421
I had a double-yolk egg the other day.

00:19:45.155 --> 00:19:46.156
Everything will be fine.

00:19:47.557 --> 00:19:48.525
Thanks.

00:19:48.592 --> 00:19:50.160
It wasn't in the yard too.

00:19:50.227 --> 00:19:51.328
Is that so?

00:19:51.828 --> 00:19:54.531
You'll find it in no time.

00:19:54.598 --> 00:19:56.433
Don't you think so too?

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.136
It'll be alright!

00:19:59.202 --> 00:20:00.871
Oh, this!

00:20:01.905 --> 00:20:04.007
At Suginomori Zoological & Botanical Park,

00:20:04.074 --> 00:20:06.276
there was a contest
to design the mascot character.

00:20:06.343 --> 00:20:08.679
That was ages ago though,

00:20:08.745 --> 00:20:10.681
but I actually won a special prize,

00:20:10.747 --> 00:20:12.015
and it ended up as a keychain.

00:20:12.082 --> 00:20:13.850
Is that how it was?

00:20:13.917 --> 00:20:16.553
It’s charming and cute.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.788
What's the drawing of?

00:20:17.854 --> 00:20:20.490
It’s a Tokyo bird, the black-headed gull.

00:20:20.557 --> 00:20:22.726
The mascot is a gull shaped like Tokyo.

00:20:22.793 --> 00:20:23.727
A gull, you say?

00:20:23.794 --> 00:20:24.995
Gull, huh?

00:20:25.062 --> 00:20:26.296
Now that you mention it…

00:20:26.363 --> 00:20:27.864
Although for a gull,

00:20:27.931 --> 00:20:30.667
it has a few too many legs, no?

00:20:31.435 --> 00:20:32.869
I'm ashamed,

00:20:32.936 --> 00:20:34.671
but the fact that birds have two legs

00:20:34.738 --> 00:20:36.673
is something I only realized today.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.442
-That's a flamingo.
-A flamingo, indeed.

00:20:39.009 --> 00:20:40.610
I drew while carefully observing it.

00:20:41.278 --> 00:20:44.147
And then all kinds of things
started to become clear.

00:20:45.982 --> 00:20:48.118
It’s really fun!

00:20:48.185 --> 00:20:50.987
Please fill out this lost property report.

00:20:51.054 --> 00:20:52.089
Okay.

00:20:54.157 --> 00:20:55.759
Ah, Mr. Ichigaya.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.264
Mr. Hatano.

00:21:02.833 --> 00:21:04.267
-Hello.
-What's the matter?

00:21:04.334 --> 00:21:06.670
My tortoise disappeared.

00:21:07.237 --> 00:21:08.305
-A tortoise?
-Yeah.

00:21:08.372 --> 00:21:10.107
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

00:21:10.173 --> 00:21:11.141
I'll take my leave now.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:14.411
Tortoise, huh?

00:21:16.313 --> 00:21:17.647
Genichi Hatano?

00:21:19.583 --> 00:21:22.753
Look forward to it! I'm gonna hang up now.

00:21:22.819 --> 00:21:23.787
Alrighty.

00:21:23.854 --> 00:21:27.758
HAPPY STORE

00:21:35.899 --> 00:21:38.034
SAKU

00:21:40.704 --> 00:21:42.606
-He’s not picking up.
-Perhaps he's busy.

00:21:42.672 --> 00:21:44.474
This is my first time doing
something like this.

00:21:44.541 --> 00:21:45.842
How do I put it?

00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:47.010
Going against the flow?

00:21:47.077 --> 00:21:48.779
Whether a relationship is starting

00:21:48.845 --> 00:21:50.414
or ending,

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.681
I usually let it play out.

00:21:51.748 --> 00:21:53.016
Isn’t that a good thing?

00:21:53.817 --> 00:21:54.751
-Well then,
-What?

00:21:54.818 --> 00:21:56.887
I'll need to do prep work before going
to the property agency,

00:21:56.953 --> 00:21:58.355
as well as many other things.

00:21:58.422 --> 00:22:00.257
-Um, is it regarding your condo?
-Yes.

00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:03.193
I'd like to go to the property agency too.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.594
Pardon?

00:22:04.661 --> 00:22:06.163
Please come back!

00:22:06.229 --> 00:22:09.032
I’ll limit myself to three…

00:22:09.099 --> 00:22:11.768
no, five boiled eggs a day.

00:22:11.835 --> 00:22:13.236
So, please!

00:22:14.805 --> 00:22:17.674
Come on, Super Contract!

00:22:24.448 --> 00:22:27.250
You’re taking the afternoon off today,
right, Hatano?

00:22:27.317 --> 00:22:28.785
Yes, that's right.

00:22:28.852 --> 00:22:30.454
Are you going somewhere with your mom?

00:22:32.088 --> 00:22:33.657
It's for something else.

00:22:38.295 --> 00:22:39.129
What’s wrong?

00:22:39.196 --> 00:22:41.331
If you had known the boar
was going to die,

00:22:41.398 --> 00:22:43.366
what would you have done for it?

00:22:45.602 --> 00:22:47.037
I guess I'd pet it a lot,

00:22:47.103 --> 00:22:49.706
smile at it, maybe sing…

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.408
or dance?

00:22:51.975 --> 00:22:54.177
Words don’t reach animals, right?

00:22:54.744 --> 00:22:55.579
So,

00:22:55.645 --> 00:22:58.715
I’d do anything to show them I’m grateful.

00:22:59.216 --> 00:23:03.220
Family register… Driver’s license…

00:23:03.286 --> 00:23:04.454
Sakuta!

00:23:05.021 --> 00:23:06.523
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:23:07.257 --> 00:23:08.692
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

00:23:10.961 --> 00:23:13.363
Um… Are you really, truly okay with this?

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.032
-Are you chickening out?
-Yes, I am.

00:23:16.099 --> 00:23:18.034
You’re the one who said we should do it.

00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:20.170
But a partnership

00:23:20.237 --> 00:23:21.938
is like getting married, right?

00:23:22.005 --> 00:23:24.674
I don’t really think of it as marriage.

00:23:24.741 --> 00:23:27.344
-What?
-We have to submit it!

00:23:28.278 --> 00:23:30.380
Well, even if we do,

00:23:31.014 --> 00:23:34.417
things rarely go smoothly for couples
like us, so it's just for the sake of it.

00:23:35.819 --> 00:23:38.121
-That’s very procedural.
-It's important, no?

00:23:40.457 --> 00:23:42.959
Hey, mind if we stop here?

00:23:43.026 --> 00:23:43.894
Not at all.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.262
So, are those two…

00:23:46.296 --> 00:23:48.031
-getting along well?
-Huh?

00:23:48.098 --> 00:23:50.300
Genichi and Sakuta.

00:23:51.434 --> 00:23:55.005
Yes, very. All things considered,
they're lovey-dovey all the time.

00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:56.206
Really?

00:23:56.273 --> 00:23:59.075
They just can’t hide
their lovey-dovey vibes, both of them.

00:24:00.043 --> 00:24:01.745
Is that how it is?

00:24:02.913 --> 00:24:04.014
Really now…

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.682
When I said, "We’re here to submit

00:24:05.749 --> 00:24:07.918
a partnership registration,"

00:24:07.984 --> 00:24:09.452
didn’t they make a weird face?

00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:10.787
You’re overthinking it.

00:24:16.192 --> 00:24:18.428
Are you really, really,
really sure about this?

00:24:18.495 --> 00:24:19.896
You're being persistent.

00:24:20.664 --> 00:24:21.965
-Sorry for the wait.
-Yes.

00:24:22.032 --> 00:24:23.433
Please wait a little more over there.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.069
THREE STEPS TO A HAPPY ENDING

00:24:29.306 --> 00:24:30.674
Ms. Umou,

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.510
let’s sign lots and get everyone excited!

00:24:33.577 --> 00:24:36.246
Do people even want my autograph?

00:24:36.313 --> 00:24:38.048
Of course!

00:24:38.114 --> 00:24:39.282
After all,

00:24:39.916 --> 00:24:41.451
things like a "Happy Ending" and such,

00:24:42.118 --> 00:24:44.921
when there are so many people
in the world who aren’t happy,

00:24:46.022 --> 00:24:47.691
it feels a bit shallow…

00:24:48.858 --> 00:24:51.695
-I'm taking it now.
-Set it to burst mode, okay?

00:24:51.761 --> 00:24:52.796
-Burst mode.
-Yes.

00:24:52.862 --> 00:24:53.964
Got it.

00:25:01.438 --> 00:25:02.405
How's this?

00:25:05.308 --> 00:25:07.243
Perfect!

00:25:08.211 --> 00:25:09.479
Thanks!

00:25:11.681 --> 00:25:14.250
What got you into boys' love manga?

00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:17.554
When Genichi…

00:25:18.355 --> 00:25:19.956
told me he was gay,

00:25:20.023 --> 00:25:21.992
I thought I'd try learning about it.

00:25:22.058 --> 00:25:24.995
Of course, I read proper books
with words too, you know.

00:25:25.061 --> 00:25:26.463
But in the middle of all that…

00:25:27.664 --> 00:25:29.666
I discovered boys’ love manga.

00:25:30.667 --> 00:25:32.268
After reading all sorts of them,

00:25:32.335 --> 00:25:34.204
I got totally hooked!

00:25:34.771 --> 00:25:37.073
And now 3Happy is my favorite.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.775
So, that's how it is.

00:25:38.842 --> 00:25:40.577
Do you have something you like, Hotaru?

00:25:46.049 --> 00:25:47.083
It's a secret.

00:25:49.052 --> 00:25:50.487
If it’s a secret,

00:25:51.087 --> 00:25:52.355
that means you do have one.

00:25:54.024 --> 00:25:55.992
First, regarding the partnership system,

00:25:56.059 --> 00:25:58.561
please allow me explain it again.
This system

00:25:58.628 --> 00:26:01.998
is for couples where both, or either one,
identify as a sexual minority.

00:26:02.065 --> 00:26:04.000
As life partners to each other,

00:26:04.067 --> 00:26:07.504
they respect each other's rights,
continuously support one another,

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.106
and promise to live together.
Only such couples

00:26:10.173 --> 00:26:11.841
are able to register under this system.

00:26:11.908 --> 00:26:14.577
-Okay.
-We'll start with identity verification.

00:26:14.644 --> 00:26:17.781
Mr. Genichi Hatano, please show your ID.

00:26:22.752 --> 00:26:24.054
Hatano!

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.289
Ah, sorry.

00:26:26.356 --> 00:26:27.323
Are you okay?

00:26:27.991 --> 00:26:30.393
I don’t know. I’m kind of scared.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.394
Scared of what?

00:26:32.295 --> 00:26:33.863
I’m feeling so happy, it's scary.

00:26:35.365 --> 00:26:37.300
Sorry, please continue.

00:26:37.367 --> 00:26:39.135
Please move forward and close the gap.

00:26:43.273 --> 00:26:44.674
Oh my God!

00:26:44.741 --> 00:26:47.177
I’m so glad I’m alive!

00:26:47.243 --> 00:26:49.979
It’s like getting to meet God.

00:26:50.947 --> 00:26:52.582
And I’m not even dead yet.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.252
-Oh dear me! What do I do!
-Please calm down.

00:26:56.319 --> 00:26:57.654
Sorry.

00:26:59.622 --> 00:27:02.125
If you dissolve the partnership or move,

00:27:02.192 --> 00:27:03.860
you'll need to return the certificate.

00:27:03.927 --> 00:27:06.362
Do you want an acceptance certificate
for the card?

00:27:07.097 --> 00:27:07.931
Yes, please.

00:27:07.997 --> 00:27:10.834
Very well. By presenting
this card or certificate,

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.336
you’ll be able to access
various administrative services.

00:27:13.403 --> 00:27:16.906
You can use it for public housing,
childcare, welfare,

00:27:16.973 --> 00:27:20.710
and more hospitals are starting
to accept it too, so feel free to use it.

00:27:20.777 --> 00:27:21.611
Okay!

00:27:21.678 --> 00:27:23.913
Now, let’s check the documents.

00:27:26.516 --> 00:27:27.550
Here you go.

00:27:29.619 --> 00:27:32.422
Alright. We’ll issue the certificate,
so please wait a moment.

00:27:32.489 --> 00:27:33.690
Thank you!

00:27:37.527 --> 00:27:39.729
Are you really, really, really, truly

00:27:39.796 --> 00:27:40.663
okay with this?

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:42.398
You're really annoying, okay?

00:27:43.666 --> 00:27:45.735
Calling a house a "clamp"…

00:27:46.302 --> 00:27:47.771
is honestly kind of just talk.

00:27:48.838 --> 00:27:50.406
Even if it’s just talk or a lie…

00:27:52.342 --> 00:27:54.711
if you truly believe it,
it will become real.

00:27:57.046 --> 00:27:57.881
‎Okay.

00:28:00.717 --> 00:28:01.651
There you have it.

00:28:02.318 --> 00:28:04.220
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:28:04.287 --> 00:28:05.188
These are for you.

00:28:06.356 --> 00:28:07.857
I appreciate it.

00:28:11.327 --> 00:28:12.762
May I please have your autograph?

00:28:19.969 --> 00:28:21.771
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

00:28:23.173 --> 00:28:25.475
Could we shake hands?

00:28:26.643 --> 00:28:28.111
Yes, if you don’t mind…

00:28:29.913 --> 00:28:32.482
-Um…
-Yes?

00:28:33.183 --> 00:28:34.984
My son…

00:28:36.619 --> 00:28:37.821
He's gay.

00:28:40.089 --> 00:28:42.358
When my son came out to me,

00:28:42.425 --> 00:28:43.760
telling me he was gay,

00:28:43.827 --> 00:28:46.329
I cried, thinking
he was such a poor thing.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:48.131
As you know…

00:28:48.198 --> 00:28:50.800
the world is harsh to people like him.

00:28:52.535 --> 00:28:55.972
But I tried to come to terms with it
in my own way,

00:28:56.039 --> 00:28:57.907
and in front of my son,

00:28:57.974 --> 00:29:00.276
I wanted to be a good mom.

00:29:00.343 --> 00:29:01.811
Still…

00:29:02.312 --> 00:29:04.681
I couldn’t fully be at ease.

00:29:05.215 --> 00:29:06.883
I always believed that two men

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.152
couldn’t truly be happy together.

00:29:09.219 --> 00:29:10.854
I was a firm believer of that.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.690
But look at Iwai and Ko.

00:29:13.756 --> 00:29:15.992
They’re so happy together, aren’t they?

00:29:16.626 --> 00:29:18.628
And that’s when it hit me!

00:29:19.596 --> 00:29:21.664
No matter who you fall in love with,

00:29:22.398 --> 00:29:24.500
people can be happy.

00:29:25.201 --> 00:29:26.936
So, even my son

00:29:27.003 --> 00:29:29.239
is by no means unhappy.

00:29:29.305 --> 00:29:30.874
Something as obvious as that

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.675
is what I've only just realized.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:35.245
From the bottom of my heart…

00:29:36.913 --> 00:29:38.081
I'm really…

00:29:39.515 --> 00:29:40.750
I'm so grateful to you!

00:29:42.485 --> 00:29:44.454
H-How is he, really?

00:29:45.655 --> 00:29:50.560
-What do you mean?
-Is your son happy?

00:29:51.327 --> 00:29:52.996
Well…

00:29:54.364 --> 00:29:57.700
It seems he is! Isn't that right?

00:29:57.767 --> 00:29:59.636
Yes. Incredibly so.

00:30:01.137 --> 00:30:02.672
A happy ending?

00:30:02.739 --> 00:30:05.642
Yes. I’d say it’s a happy ending for me!

00:30:08.278 --> 00:30:09.479
Is that so?

00:30:11.681 --> 00:30:12.548
If that's the case,

00:30:13.283 --> 00:30:14.217
that’s good to hear!

00:30:14.284 --> 00:30:15.251
Yes.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.154
Alright, I’m taking it now…

00:30:18.221 --> 00:30:20.323
Three, two, one!

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.659
Looks good.

00:30:22.725 --> 00:30:25.828
U-Um, could we try a different pose?

00:30:25.895 --> 00:30:26.729
Sure!

00:30:26.796 --> 00:30:28.531
Let’s jump, Sakuta.

00:30:28.598 --> 00:30:30.900
-Why?
-Ready, set, go!

00:30:31.768 --> 00:30:32.635
Smile!

00:30:32.702 --> 00:30:33.636
-Okay.
-Ready, set, go!

00:30:34.203 --> 00:30:35.038
Nice!

00:30:35.104 --> 00:30:36.205
Smile, okay?

00:30:36.272 --> 00:30:37.540
Ready, set, go!

00:30:38.675 --> 00:30:40.276
So, you’ve decided to believe in it?

00:30:40.877 --> 00:30:42.445
None of your business.

00:30:42.512 --> 00:30:44.714
I just really need something
to latch onto right now.

00:30:44.781 --> 00:30:45.982
I recommend one place.

00:30:46.049 --> 00:30:49.152
It’s old, but pets are allowed,

00:30:49.218 --> 00:30:51.354
and the landlord is a really nice person…

00:30:51.421 --> 00:30:52.789
Are you sure about that?

00:30:54.557 --> 00:30:55.425
Have a look.

00:30:55.491 --> 00:30:56.426
Hello.

00:30:57.327 --> 00:30:58.394
Hello!

00:30:58.962 --> 00:31:01.030
-Uh…
-This is Mr. Yoshida.

00:31:01.097 --> 00:31:02.999
He wants to consult you, Mr. Okabe.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.469
Welcome. Please have a seat.

00:31:08.538 --> 00:31:09.672
Are you looking for a house?

00:31:09.739 --> 00:31:10.707
-Yes.
-Okay.

00:31:10.773 --> 00:31:11.774
Please give me a moment.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.379
What kind of house are you looking for?

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.350
Well, one that can act as a "clamp".

00:31:20.416 --> 00:31:21.184
-Huh?
-What?

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:22.452
-Really?
-What?

00:31:22.518 --> 00:31:24.053
Wait, is that a trend now?

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.456
-I've heard about it before too.
-Is it a trend?

00:31:27.323 --> 00:31:29.359
-I might have started the trend.
-What?

00:31:29.425 --> 00:31:32.495
I suggested to someone
that if they wanted to stay together,

00:31:32.562 --> 00:31:35.231
perhaps they would need a "clamp".

00:31:35.298 --> 00:31:36.466
After hearing that,

00:31:36.532 --> 00:31:39.135
they proposed buying a house
for their partner.

00:31:39.202 --> 00:31:41.938
Does that person wear glasses?

00:31:42.005 --> 00:31:43.439
-Do they own a dog?
-Do they sing?

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.608
Uh…

00:31:46.309 --> 00:31:49.045
Ah! See? It's this place!

00:31:49.545 --> 00:31:50.646
That person lives here!

00:31:50.713 --> 00:31:51.848
I knew it!

00:31:51.914 --> 00:31:53.950
-Right.
-What?

00:32:03.192 --> 00:32:04.927
No one’s here right now.

00:32:05.461 --> 00:32:07.096
Yeah.

00:32:19.275 --> 00:32:20.109
Huh?

00:32:22.145 --> 00:32:23.046
A tortoise?

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.248
Huh.

00:32:28.484 --> 00:32:32.889
When the rugosa roses

00:32:32.955 --> 00:32:37.193
Bloom

00:32:38.594 --> 00:32:41.964
On the Cape of Shiretoko…

00:32:42.899 --> 00:32:44.901
Hotaru.

00:32:45.735 --> 00:32:46.602
Will you play for me?

00:32:47.703 --> 00:32:48.805
I can't play the guitar.

00:32:48.871 --> 00:32:51.707
Just give it a try.
You don't have to be perfect.

00:32:59.782 --> 00:33:00.950
Sorry,

00:33:01.017 --> 00:33:03.319
I'd like to have a talk with Saku.

00:33:15.932 --> 00:33:18.534
-Oh, welcome back.
-I'm back.

00:33:18.601 --> 00:33:21.671
Hotaru's got more talent than you do.

00:33:22.338 --> 00:33:23.506
Maybe so.

00:33:23.573 --> 00:33:25.875
Hey, I heard you two

00:33:25.942 --> 00:33:27.743
are getting along nicely?

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:30.079
Hotaru has told me all about it.

00:33:30.146 --> 00:33:31.013
That’s how I see it.

00:33:32.115 --> 00:33:33.082
Come on.

00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:35.351
Tell me about it!

00:33:35.418 --> 00:33:36.519
I'll use it as material.

00:33:37.353 --> 00:33:38.187
What material?

00:33:38.254 --> 00:33:40.556
I’m thinking of drawing it myself.

00:33:40.623 --> 00:33:41.591
A boys' love manga.

00:33:42.158 --> 00:33:44.093
Please don't.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.628
It's going to be my posthumous work!

00:33:45.695 --> 00:33:46.729
Really now…

00:33:47.563 --> 00:33:49.765
You’re always such a spoilsport!

00:33:52.034 --> 00:33:52.869
Never mind.

00:33:55.538 --> 00:33:56.672
I'll tell you.

00:33:58.207 --> 00:33:59.175
I'll tell you anything.

00:33:59.976 --> 00:34:01.577
Anything, huh?

00:34:01.644 --> 00:34:03.679
Is there anything else I can do?

00:34:04.847 --> 00:34:06.082
Not really.

00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:09.352
There’s nothing, really!

00:34:11.721 --> 00:34:13.222
In that case, I'll sing.

00:34:14.357 --> 00:34:17.960
-I’ll sing, so just listen.
-Huh?

00:34:18.628 --> 00:34:20.329
Let’s start over.

00:34:22.131 --> 00:34:23.032
Huh?

00:34:23.733 --> 00:34:24.567
This time,

00:34:24.634 --> 00:34:27.170
I’ll seriously think about
how we can stay together.

00:34:27.236 --> 00:34:28.304
HOME FOR SALE

00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:32.108
-Sorry.
-Huh?

00:34:32.175 --> 00:34:35.678
I went with Hatano to file
our partnership registration,

00:34:36.712 --> 00:34:38.381
and we plan to buy a house together.

00:34:40.516 --> 00:34:42.451
You're really in love…

00:34:42.985 --> 00:34:44.320
with that guy, huh?

00:34:45.221 --> 00:34:47.757
I'm not sure if it's love or not,
be it a "clamp"

00:34:47.823 --> 00:34:50.259
or "love and revolution"…

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.362
But I thought maybe
I could believe in that.

00:34:55.164 --> 00:34:57.667
That just means you're
head over heels for him.

00:35:01.003 --> 00:35:02.872
We’ll be happy our way,

00:35:02.939 --> 00:35:04.907
so you do your thing and be happy too.

00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:08.044
This isn't your happy ending, right?

00:35:09.545 --> 00:35:12.381
-What's my happy ending?
-I don't know.

00:35:19.288 --> 00:35:21.524
After playing the 5th fret,
press the 3rd fret.

00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:23.526
Repeat the sequence three times.

00:35:23.593 --> 00:35:24.760
That's it.

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:28.931
Your son will sing now.

00:35:30.032 --> 00:35:31.601
"The Tortoise Song".

00:35:31.667 --> 00:35:32.802
Ready, set, go!

00:35:32.868 --> 00:35:37.206
Snail-y, snail-y, slow and steady
Tip-tap, tip-tap, ready, ready

00:35:37.273 --> 00:35:41.510
Sloshy, sloshy, wiggly feet
Scurry, scurry, tiny beat

00:35:41.577 --> 00:35:45.848
Walking slow but feeling strong

00:35:46.415 --> 00:35:50.219
Gonna live a life so long

00:35:50.786 --> 00:35:54.857
Snail-y, snail-y, shell so tough
Tip-tap, tip-tap, slow but rough

00:35:54.924 --> 00:35:59.228
Sloshy, sloshy, wiggly feet
Scurry, scurry, tiny beat

00:35:59.295 --> 00:36:03.566
Shell is hard, I’m feeling proud

00:36:04.533 --> 00:36:08.337
Gonna live long, shout it loud

00:36:08.404 --> 00:36:12.875
Snail-y, snail-y, stretch my neck
Tip-tap, tip-tap, what the heck

00:36:12.942 --> 00:36:17.179
Sloshy, sloshy, wiggly feet
Scurry, scurry, tiny beat

00:36:17.246 --> 00:36:21.717
Stretch my neck, I'm feeling fine

00:36:22.518 --> 00:36:26.389
Gonna live a long, long time

00:36:26.455 --> 00:36:31.394
Where am I? Oh, look around

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.964
What a lovely place I've found

00:36:45.441 --> 00:36:46.375
You did well, Hotaru.

00:37:01.123 --> 00:37:02.925
"It’s scary to put into words.

00:37:03.526 --> 00:37:05.828
Because I didn’t believe
in a happy ending.

00:37:07.563 --> 00:37:09.065
But I…

00:37:09.665 --> 00:37:11.334
met you.

00:37:16.639 --> 00:37:17.506
I love you.

00:37:19.408 --> 00:37:21.277
Together, surely…"

00:37:25.247 --> 00:37:26.182
"Finally…

00:37:27.383 --> 00:37:28.718
you said it."

00:37:29.352 --> 00:37:30.953
THREE STEPS TO A HAPPY ENDING

00:37:40.129 --> 00:37:41.630
Where's the convenience store?

00:37:41.697 --> 00:37:42.998
-I'd like to go there.
-Okay.

00:37:43.065 --> 00:37:44.333
Is it this way?

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.168
Do you need something?

00:37:47.636 --> 00:37:49.405
I found a tortoise.

00:37:51.173 --> 00:37:52.908
Ah! Okay.

00:37:52.975 --> 00:37:54.643
-Please head this way.
-Okay.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:57.179
GUARDING SMILES & PEACE OF MIND
RECRUITING POLICE OFFICERS

00:37:57.246 --> 00:37:59.615
Are you sure you can go home by yourself?

00:37:59.682 --> 00:38:01.617
Yes, I'm sure.

00:38:02.218 --> 00:38:03.119
Really?

00:38:04.153 --> 00:38:06.856
Yes. I'm fine by myself from here.

00:38:06.922 --> 00:38:07.957
Thank you.

00:38:10.926 --> 00:38:14.263
I thought you were prepared for it, no?

00:38:15.398 --> 00:38:16.232
I was, but…

00:38:16.298 --> 00:38:19.568
No need to worry.
I’ll be in touch with you again.

00:38:21.704 --> 00:38:22.705
Oh, last thing.

00:38:23.906 --> 00:38:25.741
Can you just say this line here

00:38:25.808 --> 00:38:27.009
for me?

00:38:28.944 --> 00:38:29.979
No.

00:38:31.614 --> 00:38:32.681
Spoilsport.

00:38:36.318 --> 00:38:37.153
I'm sorry.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:42.124
I'm sorry…

00:38:43.025 --> 00:38:43.859
for everything.

00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:49.265
Your mom…

00:38:50.633 --> 00:38:52.802
is really happy now, you know?

00:38:59.275 --> 00:39:00.142
Okay then.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:02.611
Good luck.

00:39:05.648 --> 00:39:06.482
See you.

00:39:25.701 --> 00:39:27.002
I have something to announce.

00:39:28.137 --> 00:39:28.971
Okay.

00:39:32.007 --> 00:39:33.576
We’re officially partners now.

00:39:33.642 --> 00:39:35.110
PARTNERSHIP REGISTRATION CARD

00:39:35.177 --> 00:39:36.045
Uh…

00:39:36.946 --> 00:39:38.647
Congratulations.

00:39:38.714 --> 00:39:40.950
Since you’ve helped so much,

00:39:41.016 --> 00:39:42.084
I thought we'd let you know.

00:39:42.952 --> 00:39:43.786
Yeah.

00:39:43.853 --> 00:39:46.789
About what's going forward…

00:39:47.923 --> 00:39:48.757
Yes?

00:39:52.328 --> 00:39:54.630
…I'll continue to act as your parent.

00:39:55.698 --> 00:39:58.567
You can plan your future, and everything
beyond it, with peace of mind.

00:39:59.201 --> 00:40:02.571
Whatever you decide,
Hatano and I have agreed to cooperate.

00:40:03.939 --> 00:40:06.208
And, of course, as your teacher,
I’ll support you too.

00:40:08.477 --> 00:40:12.381
-So, you’re not spending the 30 million?
-Nope.

00:40:12.448 --> 00:40:15.851
You'd be violating the contract.
Are you sure about this?

00:40:16.418 --> 00:40:18.888
If it wasn't for you, Hotaru, we probably

00:40:18.954 --> 00:40:21.857
wouldn’t have become partners.
Me and Sakuta, that is.

00:40:22.925 --> 00:40:25.194
So, thank you.

00:40:26.262 --> 00:40:28.998
I hope we can continue from here on out.

00:40:30.633 --> 00:40:31.800
Yes, please.

00:40:40.643 --> 00:40:42.645
Alright, let’s decide
on your career path then.

00:40:42.711 --> 00:40:45.381
-Already?
-What are you talking about?

00:40:45.447 --> 00:40:48.083
The parent-teacher meeting
was two months ago!

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:49.618
-Right.
-Um…

00:40:50.653 --> 00:40:52.588
I also have something to announce.

00:40:53.188 --> 00:40:54.423
What is it?

00:40:55.791 --> 00:40:56.926
I found…

00:40:57.459 --> 00:41:00.262
what I love and what I want to do freely.

00:41:02.831 --> 00:41:03.999
And that is?

00:41:06.635 --> 00:41:07.770
The guitar.

00:41:08.537 --> 00:41:11.206
I love guitars.

00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:15.244
Really?

00:41:15.311 --> 00:41:17.880
I don't know why, but I'm happy about it.

00:41:18.514 --> 00:41:20.816
Oh wow. What do we do,

00:41:20.883 --> 00:41:22.885
-Sakuta?
-You're way too excited.

00:41:22.952 --> 00:41:25.120
If you'd like,

00:41:25.187 --> 00:41:28.023
I can teach you anytime,
as much as you want.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:29.325
I don't mean the playing part.

00:41:29.391 --> 00:41:31.360
-What?
-Huh?

00:41:31.427 --> 00:41:32.795
I mean the making part.

00:41:33.729 --> 00:41:36.231
I want to make guitars.

00:41:37.099 --> 00:41:39.635
So, until my mom comes back,

00:41:40.202 --> 00:41:41.637
I’ll be in your care.

00:41:43.405 --> 00:41:45.374
After the beep tone,

00:41:45.441 --> 00:41:48.077
please leave your name and message.

00:41:49.211 --> 00:41:50.980
Hello, Mom?

00:41:51.046 --> 00:41:53.816
I found something I love.

00:41:55.084 --> 00:41:56.151
But it’s a little scary.

00:41:56.752 --> 00:41:58.220
When I have things I love,

00:41:58.287 --> 00:42:01.490
people who matter to me,
or my own happiness,

00:42:01.557 --> 00:42:04.026
I keep thinking about
what would happen if I lost them.

00:42:04.727 --> 00:42:07.029
-Let’s eat together.
-Yeah!

00:42:10.566 --> 00:42:11.867
EGGS

00:42:14.503 --> 00:42:16.472
How about this property then?

00:42:16.538 --> 00:42:17.873
What do you think of here?

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.008
This condo here…

00:42:21.577 --> 00:42:23.345
I’m here today to look for a house

00:42:23.412 --> 00:42:24.647
for my own sake.

00:42:24.713 --> 00:42:27.549
Still, I’m going to try my best
to believe…

00:42:28.951 --> 00:42:30.419
in myself,

00:42:30.919 --> 00:42:32.888
in my feelings for what I love,

00:42:34.957 --> 00:42:36.725
in the kind words I’ve received,

00:42:37.292 --> 00:42:39.361
in the people who are by my side…

00:42:39.428 --> 00:42:40.529
PARTY B & C WILL SUPPORT PARTY A’S DREAM

00:42:40.596 --> 00:42:42.931
…and of course, you too, Mom.

00:42:43.432 --> 00:42:44.700
Two more left.

00:42:44.767 --> 00:42:45.567
NAGANO PREFECTURE

00:42:45.634 --> 00:42:47.336
Talk to you soon. Bye.

00:42:47.403 --> 00:42:48.337
Sorry for the wait.

00:42:48.937 --> 00:42:51.740
-Ah, thank you.
-Please enjoy.

00:42:57.513 --> 00:42:59.081
Doesn't this place look nice?

00:42:59.148 --> 00:43:00.449
It has big windows too.

00:43:00.516 --> 00:43:01.817
It faces west, though.

00:43:01.884 --> 00:43:03.986
Life is going to be hell
in the late afternoons.

00:43:04.053 --> 00:43:04.987
Is that right?

00:43:07.489 --> 00:43:08.390
How about this one?

00:43:08.457 --> 00:43:10.392
Which one?

00:43:13.295 --> 00:43:14.763
I forgot you have poor eyesight.

00:43:16.098 --> 00:43:17.933
It’s just the text is small.

00:43:20.402 --> 00:43:22.204
Wait, this one is amazing!

00:43:31.714 --> 00:43:32.548
Huh?

00:43:33.382 --> 00:43:36.118
You’ll die one day too, right, Hatano?

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.556
I love you, Hatano.

00:43:44.093 --> 00:43:45.227
You finally said it.

00:43:51.166 --> 00:43:53.502
