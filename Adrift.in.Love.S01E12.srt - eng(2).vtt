Hongfa Chairman Zhou Xiao Qi
has been plagued by scandals

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.535
causing a sharp decline in performance.

00:02:37.535 --> 00:02:40.413
This morning, union representatives
gathered at the headquarters to protest.

00:02:40.413 --> 00:02:43.457
Let's hear what Director Qian Li Hua says.

00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:48.713
Many of these employees have
worked hard with Chairman Zhan.

00:02:48.713 --> 00:02:51.737
I've communicated with most
of Hongfa's directors.

00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:53.094
We all agree that.

00:02:53.094 --> 00:02:55.887
Chairman Zhou should release
the paternity test report

00:02:55.887 --> 00:02:59.265
to the public and the company.

00:03:09.275 --> 00:03:10.443
Xiao Qi.

00:03:10.443 --> 00:03:13.044
Chairman Wu came to see you today.

00:03:14.614 --> 00:03:16.157
What did he say?

00:03:16.157 --> 00:03:19.532
He wants you to explain yourself.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.492
Otherwise, he won't support us.

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:26.789
If we lose Chairman Wu's support,

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:30.060
our chances of keeping
management rights will be even lower.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.170
Got it.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:37.717
Xiao Qi.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.594
The child is clearly Chairman Zhan's.

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:42.388
Why won't you release the report?

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:50.020
Because Dr. Gu is my lover.

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:54.984
He still thinks the child is his.

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:03.534
I know this is a bad question,

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.120
but if that's the case,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.373
why did you marry Chairman Zhan?

00:04:10.357 --> 00:04:12.818
Because I wanted to pay off Dr. Gu's debt.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.296
He was framed and owed a lot of money.

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:16.881
I wanted to help him.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:22.095
Actually, I also thought
the baby was his at first.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.971
But I didn't expect...

00:04:29.852 --> 00:04:31.645
Surprised?

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.065
Very.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.112
I'm surprised you're so honest with me.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.280
Actually, lying is very lonely.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.909
I also want to be understood.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.371
I might not be able to understand you,

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:54.043
but I will always support you.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.928
I don't want Gu Hou Ze to know the truth.

00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:06.848
I also don't want to give up
the management rights.

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:09.684
So, even if Chairman Wu doesn't support us,

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:10.685
it doesn't matter.

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:14.439
We still have Qian Xiao An's
kickback case to investigate.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.276
And Chaomai's public takeover, too.

00:05:17.276 --> 00:05:19.485
We might not lose.

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:21.028
We have to persevere.

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:27.869
What about you?

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:29.870
How's Xin Yi Fu doing?

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.419
We had a big fight.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.844
Is what he said about Lin Feng Hua true?

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:48.139
He said they're just working partners.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.557
Do you believe him?

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.478
To be honest...

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.649
It's hard for me to believe him.

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.485
But if I don't believe him...

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:04.613
I can't do it either.

00:06:06.995 --> 00:06:10.164
I've been thinking about it
since the article came out.

00:06:10.164 --> 00:06:13.375
Maybe the problem is between us.

00:06:14.877 --> 00:06:18.256
I've been thinking about it every day.

00:06:18.256 --> 00:06:20.842
Is he happy with me?

00:06:20.842 --> 00:06:23.385
Am I restricting him?

00:06:27.098 --> 00:06:30.017
If you can't let go, don't force yourself to.

00:06:30.893 --> 00:06:32.394
It's okay.

00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:37.025
If you want to be with him,

00:06:37.025 --> 00:06:39.276
then trust him completely.

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:46.576
Dr. Gu, can you please get out of the car?

00:06:46.576 --> 00:06:48.202
Dr. Gu, do you have anything to say today?

00:06:48.202 --> 00:06:51.080
Dr. Gu, can you comment on the news report?

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.540
Dr. Gu, before Ms. Zhou married Mr. Zhan,

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.292
you knew she was pregnant, right?

00:06:54.292 --> 00:06:57.128
Did she tell you she was pregnant
before marriage, or did you support her?

00:06:57.128 --> 00:06:59.001
How could you let Ms. Zhou marry Mr. Zhan?

00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:00.670
Do you only target rich women?

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.423
Do you always mess with your patients?

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.550
Why did you snatch the microphone?
Are you feeling guilty?

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.717
Do you have anything to say?

00:07:06.717 --> 00:07:08.511
How could you lose your temper as a doctor?

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.720
Are you angry out of embarrassment?

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.514
Dr. Gu, please comment.

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:13.464
Don't you have any morals?

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:16.310
It's in the news.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.604
How long do you want to keep her here?

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:19.647
Mr. Wei.

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:22.316
I know you want Ms. Fan to be discharged.

00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:26.195
But there are professional procedures
for patients to be admitted or discharged.

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:29.699
We can't simply judge
based on the magazine's report.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.619
But you can't say she's delusional
and keep her here.

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:35.288
Please give me some time.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:38.040
I'll get some experts to evaluate this with me.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.647
I'll give you an explanation then.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.630
Can I go see Yue Jiao now?

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:48.384
Ever since this news came out,

00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:51.470
Ms. Fan has been getting
more and more out of control.

00:07:52.346 --> 00:07:56.142
She even had to be sedated
by a nurse last night.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.437
I'm afraid if you visit her now
and bring this up,

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:01.639
things will only get worse.

00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:06.944
Then can I ask you to
handle this as soon as possible?

00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:09.071
Of course, I will.

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.050
That's what the doctor said.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.677
He told me to relax.

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:23.033
After the news broke,
all the patients canceled.

00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:27.527
I guess the clinic doesn't need me anymore.

00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:32.334
Okay.

00:12:56.734 --> 00:12:58.026
Hello.

00:12:59.028 --> 00:13:00.445
Is everything okay?

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.408
I'm fine. How about you?

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:08.746
I ran into reporters at the clinic again today.

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:11.057
I think I'll stay at a hotel for a few days.

00:13:11.957 --> 00:13:13.250
Okay.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.502
You've been through a lot.

00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:18.213
I've been thinking...

00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:21.133
How about this?

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:23.385
You resign as chairperson.

00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:25.846
We'll move somewhere no one knows us.

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:28.182
We'll register our marriage.

00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:30.267
And have the baby.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:34.094
What about the money we owe?

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.485
We'll find a way.

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.740
Things will blow over soon.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.742
Let's think about it, okay?

00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:50.579
Okay, bye.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.390
Welcome.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.491
Why did you do to my grandma?

00:14:28.492 --> 00:14:30.870
What did you tell her?

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.830
Your phone was off.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.291
I couldn't find you at your rental.

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:37.376
So, I had to go to your hometown.

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:41.213
So, you're using this dirty trick
to force me to contact you?

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:44.557
I'm not so scheming as to use an old lady.

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:50.180
I heard from your grandma
that you two are very close.

00:14:51.807 --> 00:14:53.851
So, you should think about her.

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:56.882
She'd be so sad if she knew you broke the law.

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:15.664
Why did you send this to me?

00:15:15.664 --> 00:15:19.043
I want you to know what kind
of person Qian Xiao An is.

00:15:19.043 --> 00:15:23.756
He used you as a scapegoat
and ditched you when things went wrong.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:27.057
I know it sounds cruel, but to him...

00:15:27.718 --> 00:15:30.470
you're just someone who can
be replaced at any time.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.073
I was once like you.

00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:54.328
I fell in love with a man.

00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:56.538
I would do anything for him.

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:01.919
He was taking the bar exam at that time.

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:04.129
I let him stay at my place to save money.

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:06.131
I even lent him a lot of money.

00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:12.679
In the end, I saw him sleeping
with another woman at my place.

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:15.557
He even married that woman.

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:20.358
He's gone.

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:24.066
I can't get my money back.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.319
I'm not like you.

00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:30.535
He'll give me whatever I want.

00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:36.334
Are you really willing to bet
everything on this man?

00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:44.628
I've discussed it with the chairman.

00:16:44.628 --> 00:16:47.965
As long as you hand over Qian Xiao An's ledger
and account book for the rebates,

00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:50.675
we'll hire a lawyer to help you.

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:56.056
What will you gain by doing all this?

00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:59.351
I just don't want you to end up with nothing.

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:03.115
Believe me, it's too tiring to live like that.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.108
You're the one who's tired.

00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:10.232
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

00:17:10.904 --> 00:17:13.042
Thank you for sharing your story.

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:34.316
It feels like I haven't
been here for a long time.

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:37.681
I remember in the past,

00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:40.792
Shu Juan and I used to sit here
for afternoon tea.

00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:49.150
Ms. Qian, cut to the chase.

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:54.698
You're not even in a hurry
to explain to the media.

00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:56.997
What's there to be anxious about?

00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:11.340
If you can't produce the DNA paternity report,

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.592
you must have your reasons.

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:15.294
Frankly speaking,

00:18:15.294 --> 00:18:18.900
I don't care whose child you're carrying.

00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:24.228
All I want is Hongfa's management rights.

00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:25.938
So?

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:28.732
If you voluntarily resign
as Hongfa's chairperson,

00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:31.610
I'll immediately end the union's protest.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.239
The board won't force you to explain anymore.

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:37.741
Once we reach a consensus within the company,

00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:40.577
public opinion will naturally calm down.

00:18:40.577 --> 00:18:42.204
This way,

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:45.916
you can still keep your position
as a board member and your income.

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:49.153
From now on, whoever you want to be with,

00:18:49.153 --> 00:18:51.437
or what kind of life you want,

00:18:51.437 --> 00:18:53.406
no one will bother you.

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:57.639
Is that clear enough?

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:10.501
Are you still busy?

00:19:12.484 --> 00:19:14.319
It's so late. Why are you still here?

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:18.323
The Chaomai Public Acquisition Team's
strategy meeting just ended.

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:20.079
Thank you for your hard work.

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:26.034
There's something I want to tell you.

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:29.459
About you and Xin Yi Fu...

00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:31.570
The chairwoman told me everything.

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:35.591
I called Shi Weekly today.

00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:39.761
My high-ranking friend and I
discussed the chairwoman's article.

00:19:39.761 --> 00:19:42.639
I accidentally heard some funny news.

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:44.975
What is it?

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:46.852
My friend said...

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:49.780
The paparazzi photos and reports

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.066
of Xin Yi Fu and Lin Xi Ming's
daughter on a date...

00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:56.083
were actually arranged by Qian Li Hua.

00:19:59.114 --> 00:20:04.119
I think she wanted to make you angry.

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:06.538
She wanted you to leave Xin Yi Fu.

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:32.987
You're up.

00:21:40.048 --> 00:21:42.002
Come, let's have breakfast.

00:22:00.193 --> 00:22:01.486
Good morning.

00:22:02.362 --> 00:22:03.945
Good morning.

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:06.783
You came home very late last night.

00:22:06.783 --> 00:22:08.785
Yes.

00:22:08.785 --> 00:22:11.626
You were sleeping so soundly,
so I didn't want to disturb you.

00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:19.526
I've been thinking for a long time.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.546
No one can stop us.

00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:28.930
I trust you.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.432
It's fine as long as we're fine.

00:22:40.984 --> 00:22:42.277
Yeah.

00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:45.238
Yeah.

00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:48.199
Let's have breakfast.

00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:54.790
It's been a while since
we had breakfast together.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.082
That's right.

00:23:31.918 --> 00:23:37.705
[Prenatal Paternity Test]

00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:33.554
I miss you so much.

00:24:38.685 --> 00:24:41.021
I've decided.

00:24:41.021 --> 00:24:42.772
Let's leave, okay?

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.547
You wrote me a card?

00:25:02.417 --> 00:25:04.168
That's so cute.

00:25:10.383 --> 00:25:12.218
Gu Yu Fei.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.992
I feel like my life...

00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:25.398
is a tragedy.

00:25:27.317 --> 00:25:30.612
That's why I named her Yu Fei.

00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:36.075
It sounds so carefree.

00:25:38.745 --> 00:25:43.082
I hope I can give her freedom.

00:25:46.127 --> 00:25:47.462
I like it.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.384
Gu Yu Fei.

00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:57.972
Gu Yu Fei.

00:26:04.479 --> 00:26:07.190
We interrupt this program for breaking news.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:10.860
There has been a new development
in Hongfa Group's fight for control.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.239
Obstetrics and Gynecology authority,
Director Wu Shi Min, held a press conference.

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:16.825
Regarding the scandal that
Chairman Zhou Xiao Qi was exposed

00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:19.702
by a weekly magazine, and made
the latest statement.

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:23.582
Director, why did you choose
to come forward now?

00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:26.585
Chairman Zhan was my old friend.

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:29.607
The paternity test report shows that

00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:36.386
the child is Chairman Zhan's
own flesh and blood.

00:26:36.386 --> 00:26:40.223
Everyone is slandering the mother
and her orphaned child.

00:26:40.223 --> 00:26:41.850
I can't stand it anymore.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.009
Director, are you speaking
on behalf of Chairman Zhou?

00:26:47.272 --> 00:26:50.817
- I just want to tell everyone.
- What does he mean?

00:26:50.817 --> 00:26:55.028
Please don't believe false rumors anymore.

00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:44.912
So, you've been lying to me?

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:51.544
I thought the baby was yours.

00:27:51.544 --> 00:27:53.462
When did you find out?

00:27:57.175 --> 00:27:59.135
When?

00:28:07.102 --> 00:28:09.396
The day Qian Ren died.

00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:10.730
You've been lying to me until now?

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.233
- No.
- Why didn't you tell me?

00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:14.525
No.

00:28:15.944 --> 00:28:16.986
No, I was going to tell you.

00:28:16.986 --> 00:28:19.989
Zhou Xiao Qi, you'll do anything
to become the chairman.

00:28:19.989 --> 00:28:21.783
I was going to tell you.

00:28:21.783 --> 00:28:23.910
But when I saw how much
you wanted a child and a family,

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.453
I really didn't know how to tell you.

00:28:25.453 --> 00:28:29.124
I'm sorry.

00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:31.042
There's nothing more to say.

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:32.752
Don't be like this.

00:28:32.752 --> 00:28:34.378
Don't be like this, okay?

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:36.673
Don't be like this, okay? I'm sorry.

00:28:36.673 --> 00:28:38.007
I'm sorry.

00:28:38.007 --> 00:28:39.551
I didn't do it on purpose.

00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:41.136
Don't be angry.

00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:42.679
Don't be angry, okay?

00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:44.597
Don't be angry.

00:28:49.602 --> 00:28:53.481
I'm sorry.

00:29:35.732 --> 00:29:37.025
I have kleptomania.

00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:38.109
What?

00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:40.028
I have kleptomania.

00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:41.657
It's an illness.

00:29:44.032 --> 00:29:46.951
Please find my psychiatrist for me.

00:29:46.951 --> 00:29:49.204
His name is Gu Hou Ze.

00:29:49.204 --> 00:29:50.997
Please contact him for me.

00:29:51.664 --> 00:29:53.541
Ask him to come, all right?

00:30:02.425 --> 00:30:03.968
Hello, I'm calling from Kangle Police Station.

00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:05.178
My name is Zhang.

00:30:05.178 --> 00:30:08.180
Are you Zhou Xiao Qi's psychiatrist?

00:30:09.265 --> 00:30:12.894
Zhou Xiao Qi stole a lot of things
from a shop on Xin'an Road.

00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:15.645
The shop reported it. She's with us now.

00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:19.192
I see.

00:30:19.192 --> 00:30:21.444
Okay, I understand. Thank you.

00:30:23.112 --> 00:30:24.697
What did he say?

00:30:24.697 --> 00:30:27.658
He said you're no longer his patient.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.982
Is there anyone else you can contact?

00:30:41.548 --> 00:30:44.091
I'm not his patient.

00:31:00.233 --> 00:31:02.485
Pack your bags.

00:31:02.485 --> 00:31:05.280
I'll pick you up later.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.655
Do you hear me?

00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:11.535
- Hello, Sis.
- Have you seen the news?

00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:16.082
Yes, I saw it. I've asked
the union to withdraw.

00:31:16.082 --> 00:31:18.793
She just agreed to resign this afternoon.

00:31:18.793 --> 00:31:22.672
Tonight, that doctor revealed a paternity test.

00:31:22.672 --> 00:31:25.925
If Mr. Wu sees the news,
he'll turn to Zhou Xiao Qi again.

00:31:25.925 --> 00:31:27.760
Don't worry. Hear me out.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.804
As long as we keep buying Hongfa,

00:31:29.804 --> 00:31:32.557
and Mr. Huang and Lin Xi Ming's
shares add up to more than half,

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:35.351
even if Zhou Xiao Qi proves
the child is Mr. Zhan's,

00:31:35.351 --> 00:31:37.228
it's useless.

00:31:38.313 --> 00:31:40.022
Zhou Xiao Qi...

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.317
What is she up to?

00:31:42.317 --> 00:31:45.320
Sis, it's rare for you to be so anxious.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.654
Listen, I'll take care of everything.

00:31:46.654 --> 00:31:48.197
Just relax, okay?

00:31:48.197 --> 00:31:49.407
Okay, that's all for now.

00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:50.408
I have something to take care of.

00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:52.562
Alright, bye.

00:32:56.307 --> 00:32:58.100
Have you sorted it all out?

00:33:02.855 --> 00:33:06.651
What will happen to
the Vice President if I give it to you?

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:08.694
He'll pay for it.

00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:17.453
These are all the accounts and records

00:33:17.453 --> 00:33:19.497
from my time with Qian Xiao An.

00:33:19.497 --> 00:33:21.332
All the companies that took kickbacks,

00:33:21.332 --> 00:33:24.627
the contacts, the amounts,

00:33:24.627 --> 00:33:27.255
and the exact times
Qian Xiao An received money.

00:33:27.255 --> 00:33:29.006
It's all recorded here.

00:33:38.099 --> 00:33:39.600
Surprised?

00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:43.395
I'm not as stupid as you think.

00:33:45.732 --> 00:33:47.441
What will you do next?

00:33:50.194 --> 00:33:52.203
We'll take legal action.

00:33:53.406 --> 00:33:56.570
We'll discuss the details
with the lawyer and the chairman.

00:33:58.578 --> 00:34:00.028
What about you?

00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:03.374
What's your plan?

00:34:07.962 --> 00:34:09.936
I plan to leave this place.

00:34:12.133 --> 00:34:14.967
I don't want to have anything
to do with you guys anymore.

00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:20.057
Then take care of yourself.

00:34:21.184 --> 00:34:22.601
You, too.

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:33.237
That's great.

00:34:39.994 --> 00:34:41.829
Xiao Ting Yun, where are you now?

00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:45.116
Listen, call me as soon
as you get this message.

00:34:52.965 --> 00:34:54.152
[I gave all the evidence of
your kickbacks to Secretary Pan.]

00:34:54.152 --> 00:34:55.650
[This is the price you
pay for deceiving me.]

00:35:03.476 --> 00:35:06.395
Sorry, the number you dialed...

00:35:34.507 --> 00:35:37.844
Must you do this to yourself?

00:35:37.844 --> 00:35:40.012
Zhou Xiao Qi!

00:35:40.012 --> 00:35:42.932
Everyone must be responsible
for themselves.

00:35:42.932 --> 00:35:44.809
Listen up.

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:48.771
This is the last time I'll bail you
out of the police station.

00:35:48.771 --> 00:35:50.638
It won't happen again.

00:36:03.612 --> 00:36:08.975
[Pan Xin Tong]

00:36:13.296 --> 00:36:14.172
Hello.

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:18.092
Sister Xiao Qi, I got the evidence
of Qian Xiao An taking kickbacks.

00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:25.391
Grandma.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.103
I told you not to carry
so much at once. It's heavy.

00:36:29.103 --> 00:36:30.730
Let me do it.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:32.356
This is for you.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.765
Why did you suddenly come back?

00:36:35.765 --> 00:36:37.320
Why didn't you tell me?

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.904
I missed you.

00:36:39.947 --> 00:36:41.824
That's not right.

00:36:41.824 --> 00:36:44.235
Didn't the company send you abroad?

00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:46.829
I'm not going.

00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:48.873
Not going? Why?

00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:51.375
What's wrong with work?

00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:53.628
Don't worry so much.

00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:55.630
Isn't it good that I'm back
to keep you company?

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:57.423
Yes, very good.

00:36:57.423 --> 00:36:58.674
Let's go.

00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:03.536
Let's go home.

00:37:04.597 --> 00:37:06.307
You cooked so much.

00:37:06.307 --> 00:37:08.226
I can't finish everything.

00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:10.060
You're back.

00:37:14.106 --> 00:37:16.192
It smells good.

00:37:16.192 --> 00:37:18.490
Eat more if it smells good.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.364
How long are you staying this time?

00:37:26.202 --> 00:37:28.189
I'm on leave from work.

00:37:28.955 --> 00:37:31.009
I don't have to go to work for some time.

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:38.047
If you encounter any injustice at work,

00:37:38.047 --> 00:37:40.341
just come back and tell Grandma.

00:37:40.341 --> 00:37:43.469
At least Grandma can still feed you.

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:50.142
By the way, if you have time,

00:37:50.142 --> 00:37:53.145
ask that Ms. Pan from your company

00:37:53.145 --> 00:37:55.106
to come to our house.

00:37:56.899 --> 00:37:57.984
Why look for her?

00:37:57.984 --> 00:37:59.610
I don't know her that well.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:00.861
You don't know her well?

00:38:00.861 --> 00:38:02.947
She came all the way here to see you.

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:06.074
The cardboard boxes outside
were all knocked over.

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:09.537
She spent a lot of time
helping me organize them.

00:38:09.537 --> 00:38:11.330
She's so nice.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.708
I asked her to stay for dinner.

00:38:13.708 --> 00:38:15.686
She even helped me wash the dishes.

00:38:16.836 --> 00:38:19.630
She's a good girl, just like you.

00:40:02.566 --> 00:40:04.051
Pan Xin Tong!

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:09.281
Where is it? Where is it?

00:40:09.281 --> 00:40:10.324
What are you talking about?

00:40:10.324 --> 00:40:12.701
Listen to me. Just give it to me.

00:40:12.701 --> 00:40:13.828
That's mine, okay?

00:40:13.828 --> 00:40:15.287
- Just give it to me and it'll be fine.
- I told you to get out of my way!

00:40:15.287 --> 00:40:16.789
No, you don't understand what I mean.

00:40:16.789 --> 00:40:20.268
- Give it to me. That's mine.
- Qian Xiao An, stop messing around!

00:40:21.794 --> 00:40:23.814
Don't force me to do this.

00:40:25.548 --> 00:40:27.132
Don't force me to do this!

00:40:28.801 --> 00:40:30.636
Don't force me to do it.

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:34.539
Pan Xin Tong, don't force me to do it.

00:41:37.369 --> 00:41:39.330
Give it to me!

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:40.456
Qian Xiao An, what are you doing?

00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:42.917
Hand over what Xiao Ting Yun gave you to me!

00:41:42.917 --> 00:41:45.961
If you give it to me, I'll let you go, okay?

00:41:45.961 --> 00:41:47.171
You took the money?

00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:49.423
Receiving kickbacks is a minor offense.

00:41:49.423 --> 00:41:51.008
Now you've made it worse.

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:52.636
Are you crazy?

00:41:58.891 --> 00:42:00.893
What are you talking about?

00:42:00.893 --> 00:42:03.229
Utter nonsense!

00:42:03.229 --> 00:42:04.647
Damn it!

00:42:04.647 --> 00:42:05.731
Damn it!

00:42:05.731 --> 00:42:07.816
Don't spit that nonsense!

00:42:07.816 --> 00:42:09.902
Nonsense!

00:42:09.902 --> 00:42:11.278
Let me tell you something.

00:42:11.278 --> 00:42:13.531
The manufacturer came to me for help.

00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:15.241
I only took a small commission.

00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:16.367
We're all working for our own benefit.

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:19.090
What did I do wrong? Huh?

00:42:22.164 --> 00:42:23.624
Hand it over!

00:42:23.624 --> 00:42:24.667
If you don't, I'll kill you!

00:42:24.667 --> 00:42:27.294
Do you see this knife? This is a knife!

00:42:27.294 --> 00:42:28.420
I'm really going to kill you!

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.130
Help!

00:42:40.435 --> 00:42:42.424
[Yi Fu]

00:42:49.491 --> 00:42:50.523
[Yi Fu]

00:42:50.523 --> 00:42:52.966
[Swipe to turn off]

00:43:07.501 --> 00:43:10.295
Sorry, the number you dialed...

00:43:16.468 --> 00:43:19.429
Where are you? Why aren't you back yet?

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.182
Call me when you see this message.

00:44:45.599 --> 00:44:47.231
You... Why are you...
