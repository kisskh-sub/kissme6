00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.120
(Episode 119)

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.240
Se Ri...

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.940
Se Ri!

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.170
Se Ri!

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.440
Se Ri...

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.050
Se Ri!

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.520
Se Ri!

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.390
Se Ri!

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.530
Se Ri!

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.070
Are you okay? Stay with me!

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.130
Mom...

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.900
Se Ri, stay with me!

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.670
Just hang on.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.440
Don't you pass out on me, okay?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.080
I'll save you. Just hold on.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.550
Se Ri, stay with me!

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.220
Se Ri, I'm going to save you.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.690
You can't pass out, you hear me? Se Ri!

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.660
Se Ri!

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.400
Are you okay?

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.430
Se Ri, get on my back. Let's go.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.000
Hurry.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.840
Se Ri, stay with me.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.910
Stay with me, okay? Se Ri!

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.110
Se Ri!

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.890
Se Ri. Just hang in there a little longer.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.530
Se Ri, stay with me. Okay?

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.030
You're going to be okay.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.570
(Hanwon Hospital)

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.150
What's wrong with my daughter?

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.580
Why isn't she waking up?

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.680
She's been here for hours!

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.590
Calm down. We're in a hospital.
The emergency room, no less.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.750
So what?

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.690
If this is a hospital,
why aren't they tending to her?

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.190
Why has she been like this for hours?

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.120
We've done everything we can.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.230
Please be patient.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.900
This won't work.
I don't trust this hospital.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.400
Transfer her to Hankuk Hospital.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.830
Our family's primary physician is there.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.640
The transfer is up to the guardian,
but if we move her in this condition,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.840
we can't guarantee she'll be safe.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.810
I don't care, so transfer her
to Hankuk Hospital now.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.110
Are you crazy?

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.310
She said something could go wrong
while moving her.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.050
It's the same risk leaving her here.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.050
I refuse to leave Se Ri
in a dump like this.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.590
What is wrong with you?

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.630
You don't care if she dies on the way?

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.830
I don't. I'm taking her.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.440
And you call yourself her mother?

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.800
Your own child is dying,
and you don't care?

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.840
How can you possibly not care?

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.380
When your child is dying,
you should be willing to die for them.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.480
That's what a mother is!

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.150
So, what's your decision?

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.090
Are we transferring the patient or not?

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.350
- No!
- Yes!

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.160
Then you're the mother
requesting the transfer?

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.060
We will not be held responsible.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.190
Please sign here.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.400
Who says she's the mother?
I'm her mother. And I refuse to allow it.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.200
My daughter is not being moved
from this hospital.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.840
I refuse to risk watching her die
on the way.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.010
Are you insane?

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.740
What if she dies because we kept her here?

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.980
I am her mother, so do as I say.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.450
I'm her mother!

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.990
Since you both claim to be her mother,

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.190
which one of you is the real mother?

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.490
- I am!
- I am!

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.790
Until you two reach an agreement,

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.930
the patient will stay here for treatment.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.080
Manager Gong,
please tell me nothing's happened.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.910
I'm talking about Se Ri.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.480
When someone gets kidnapped,
it usually ends badly...

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.190
Watch your mouth!
You don't want to jinx it.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.020
Why are you snapping at me?

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.920
I was just saying it
because I was worried.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.230
I can't even get a hold of Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.430
Where and what is she doing?

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.530
And the chairman is no help.
This whole mess is his fault.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.340
Why can't he just give
those thugs the money?

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.340
It's not like we're short on cash.
We have plenty.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.010
You think that works on kidnappers?

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.010
They'll take the money
and do as they wish.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.610
It's not like
we can call the police, though.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.780
I can't believe this... Seriously...

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.320
(Director Min Soo Jung)

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.590
Hey.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.460
Have you heard anything from Kyung Chae?

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.330
As if she would ever call me.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.700
Seriously, a kidnapping?
Is this really happening?

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.100
Then again, this secret-love-child thing
is even crazier.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.970
I heard this from Ja Kyung,
and she said Se Ri is apparently...

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.480
Kyung Chae's daughter.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.680
What?

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.180
You already knew?

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.520
Why? How?

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.850
Wait, since when?

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.090
(Emergency Ward)

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.930
How did you find out?

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.830
That I'm Se Ri's mother.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.270
Does that even matter right now?

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.280
I'll stay here with Se Ri. You can go.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.280
But you just said
you knew I was her mother.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.250
Then you shouldn't be acting like this.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.120
Isn't it a mother's job to wait for
her unconscious child to wake up?

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.550
Who do you think you are?

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.760
Her pathetic stepmother?

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.260
You're not even that anymore, are you?

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.660
You and Father are about to
split up anyway.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.130
Get lost now.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.130
Get out of my sight.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.600
If you come near Se Ri again,
you'll regret it.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:47.610
What did you just say?

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.810
I'll tell my daughter what you were after
when you approached the chairman,

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.150
and how you ruined our family.
I'll expose everything.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.910
And when she finds out,

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.080
Se Ri will be completely
disgusted with you too.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.360
Se Ri.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.700
Stop being so arrogant and get out!

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.230
You think you can take my daughter
away from me?

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.470
Who are you to come
between me and my daughter?

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.800
Not even the skies can do that.
Understand?

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.940
Who do you think you are?

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.540
What gives you the right
to mess with my daughter?

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.310
Why are you so obsessed with my daughter?

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.680
Why?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.890
Ma'am, please get up.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.620
What do you think you're doing
in the emergency room?

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.160
You're going to make
the patient's condition worse.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.030
One of you needs to leave.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.870
Now!

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.730
How's Se Ri? Has she woken up yet?

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.090
Not yet.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.200
Should you be leaving her alone like this?
You should be by her side.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.900
Min Kyung Chae won't let me near Se Ri.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.740
She's on edge and keeps pushing me away.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.540
Why would she push you away?

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.070
Hold on.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.110
What happened to your hand?

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.920
Don't tell me you got burned saving Se Ri?

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.950
I'm fine. It's nothing.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.620
What do you mean, you're fine?

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.790
Don't you know burns can cause damage
if they aren't treated properly?

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.030
Stay right here.
I'll go get some ointment.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.600
You ran into the flames?

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.400
You really are Se Ri's mother, aren't you?

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.920
Se Ri's in the hospital.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.860
I got her out of the warehouse,

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.860
but there was a fire,
and now she's unconscious.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.390
A fire?

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.400
So those punks set the fire on purpose,
knowing she could die?

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.600
Those murderous jerks!

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.100
That's why...

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.410
I'm reporting this to the police now.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.610
If you report them,
I'll get dragged into it as well.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.750
Don't you think they'd rat me out...

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.150
for ordering them
to kidnap Moon Tae Kyung?

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.320
So?

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.780
You want me to just let
those monsters go...

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.650
so you can cover up your crime?

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.990
Are you out of your mind?
This is all your fault!

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.630
If you had lived an honest life,
would any of this have happened?

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.200
If you were raising a family,
why did you have to make enemies?

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.070
You're reaping what you sowed.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.340
If anything happens to Se Ri,

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.040
I swear I won't let you get away with it.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.980
She will soon wake up, won't she?

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.610
Of course.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.080
That's Se Ri we're talking about.
She's your daughter.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.820
She's tough, just like her mom.
I'm sure she'll pull through.

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.460
You think Se Ri takes after me?

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.260
You couldn't tell?
It was obvious to me from the start.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.030
She's so determined and brave,

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.530
and not afraid to speak her mind.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.140
It'd be harder to find
how you two are different.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.710
I'm terrified...

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.010
I will lose Se Ri,

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.150
just like I did with Mi So.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.060
When you were rushed
to the hospital that time,

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.130
I was just as scared...

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.100
as I am right now.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.970
Losing someone you love once,

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.370
like Mi So, was more than enough.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.520
That won't happen, so don't you worry.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.060
Se Ri...

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.730
is a special child to me now,

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.690
so I'll be pulling for her with you.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:42.970
If there's one more person
who is hoping and praying for her,

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.100
she'll bounce back in no time.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.580
Se Ri!

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.490
I'm sorry I'm only telling you this now,

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.560
but you're my daughter.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.530
I'm your real mom.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.060
So you don't need to go
searching for someone else.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.700
My real mom?

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.930
That's a lie.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.740
You know it's a lie,
so why are you saying that?

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.640
I'm going to find my birth mother.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.470
The poor woman
who had her daughter stolen away.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.180
You stole someone else's child...

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.410
and pretended to be my mother all along.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.840
You're a kidnapper!

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.310
I didn't know.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.050
I didn't know about it either!

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.620
Se Ri, please, believe me.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.720
I only found out recently myself.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.820
Then you should have returned me
as soon as you found out.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.690
Can you imagine how heartbroken
my real mother must be?

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.300
She had her daughter stolen from her.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.300
Se Ri! Don't go.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.000
You can't go. Don't leave your mom.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.940
No, Se Ri!

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.110
No...

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.640
Se Ri...

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:00.780
Don't go.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:02.880
Don't leave your mom.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.380
No.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.250
No!

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.640
Where are you going at this hour?

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.810
I think I need to go to the hospital.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.840
I think that woman is going to
steal Se Ri from me.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.210
What woman?

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.640
Besides, do you have any idea
what time it is?

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.510
They won't even let you see her.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:36.710
I still have to go.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.950
I have to go to protect Se Ri.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.550
For goodness' sake, Ms. Kyung Chae,
what has gotten into you?

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.690
Can someone please stop her?

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:46.720
- Stop this.
- Kyung Chae!

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.230
Where do you think you're going?

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.200
She's right.
It's awfully late to be going anywhere.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.400
Please grab her quickly.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.200
- Take her back to her room.
- Kyung Chae.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.200
- Let's go upstairs.
- Come on.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.670
We'll go upstairs and talk.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.570
- Honey, come with us.
- I have to go now!

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.570
- Ms. Kyung Chae, you can't go right now!
- Let's go upstairs.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.040
- Ms. Kyung Chae!
- Kyung Chae!

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.180
- Please, calm down!
- Let go of me!

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.280
I have to go see her!

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:11.950
Please, just let me go.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.390
What if that woman takes Se Ri from us?

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.320
Snap out of it!

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.730
Who's going to take Se Ri from you?
You said she hasn't woken up yet, right?

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:22.830
Exactly!

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.930
That's why! If that woman takes Se Ri now,
it'll be too late.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.230
I wouldn't put it past her.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.870
Haven't you seen the way she is
with Se Ri?

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.600
Who on earth is that woman?

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:34.910
I have to go.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.540
I can't just let someone take my daughter,
whom I've raised for 20 years.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.180
- Ms. Kyung Chae!
- Come on!

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.280
Get a grip, Min Kyung Chae!

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.550
No!

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.220
This can't be happening! She's my Se Ri!

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.450
I raised her for 20 years.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.220
Even if they were switched,

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.460
I raised her for 20 years,
so she's my daughter.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:55.960
Isn't that right, Manager Gong?

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.160
I put my heart and soul into raising her,
so she's my daughter!

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:01.930
Please, pull yourself together,
Ms. Kyung Chae!

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.940
Still, you should go see her tomorrow.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.140
When she regains consciousness,

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.650
the first person she'll want to see
is her mother.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.180
That's what's...

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.680
a little confusing, Madam Jang.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.520
I'm not sure who Se Ri needs more.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.230
I'm worried that if I show up,
I might just make things harder on her.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.160
But what choice do you have?
You're Se Ri's mother.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.400
It's just that the two mothers
and their daughters...

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.300
are tangled up in a twisted fate.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.770
But if you look at it another way,

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.470
your relationship couldn't possibly
be more special.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.970
You each lovingly raised...

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.940
and nursed the other's child as your own.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.510
In a way, you're each other's saviors.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.890
Min Kyung Chae will have to know...

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.620
who Mi So is, right?

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.930
She has to know the truth.
No matter how painful the truth is.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.950
I'm certain I told you to stay away.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.380
Keep your voice down.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.020
We're not the only ones here.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.020
I told you I would be the one
to stay by my daughter's side.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.390
That we don't need someone like you.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.280
I have something to say to you.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:01.220
What is wrong with you?

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:03.820
Why are you keeping me from seeing Se Ri?

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.790
Because she's my daughter.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.090
Because she is my daughter!

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.630
What are you so afraid of?

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.330
You look like you're scared to death
right now.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.430
Are you afraid...

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.240
I'm going to take her?

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.800
Take her from me?

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.070
What mother in the world
would let someone take her child?

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:24.880
Then why are you acting this way?

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.540
Because you want something
you have no right to.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.980
What could I possibly want
that I shouldn't?

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:34.820
Se Ri.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:37.960
Why are you trying to claim my daughter?

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.960
Why do you want the child
that I went through labor to have?

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.490
You went through labor to have her?

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.500
Se Ri?

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.830
Did you think I didn't?

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:49.570
I gave birth to Se Ri.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:51.570
And while we're on the subject,

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.140
what gave you the right
to run into that fire?

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.640
Why would you save my daughter?

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.440
Why?

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.710
Who do you think you are?

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.450
Because she's my daughter.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.190
What did you say?

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.530
Because Se Ri is...

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.690
my daughter.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.670
She's my daughter...

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:27.540
whom I suffered in labor to have!

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:36.710
Because she's my daughter...

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:39.150
whom I carried for ten months...

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.990
and gave birth to her over two days
that left me half-dead!

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.860
Because she's my poor daughter...

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.630
who never even had her mother's milk...

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.500
because I passed out from the pain...

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.840
the moment she came...

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.680
into this world!

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.050
Because she is my heartbroken daughter...

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:16.690
who was switched with another baby...

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.120
in the ambulance
they called to save my life!

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.260
The postpartum mother,

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.000
who was in the ambulance...

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.940
on the way to Eulju Hospital's ER
20 years ago on the Anpyeong Highway,

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.640
was me.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.010
My newborn daughter...

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.480
was completely unaware...

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.950
riding along with me...

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.820
when someone switched her
with another baby.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.030
Don't be ridiculous.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.700
How am I supposed to believe
you were that woman?

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.580
Here.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:16.950
This is Se Ri and me.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.470
You expect me to believe this?

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.210
You're out of your mind.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.850
Is there a sincere bone in your body?

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.120
Do you even know what the truth is?

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.990
Look what you did to my father.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.460
You seduced an old chairman
to become the lady of the house,

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.660
and then you stole his entire stake!

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.430
A con artist and a gold digger like you
could fake anything.

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:11.270
I'd believe a stranger off the street...

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:12.800
before I'd ever believe you.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.110
What nonsense are you trying to pull?

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.770
Believe it or not,

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.580
the truth is the truth.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.750
And at that time,

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.890
I was the one...

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.420
who saved your dying daughter.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.730
For three whole months,

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.460
she was in an incubator in the NICU.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:43.370
Everyone said it was hopeless,

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.440
but your daughter was a miracle.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.810
She proved that miracles do happen...

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.480
with that tiny,

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.420
fragile body of hers.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.460
If you're going to lie,
at least make it believable.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.100
I clearly heard that baby died.

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:16.870
How dare you use a dead child in your con?

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.110
If you're curious about your daughter,

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.440
just say the word.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.110
I'll tell you where she is.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.740
So, how's Se Ri?

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.680
Any sign of her waking up?

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.680
If you're so curious,
go see for yourself instead of asking me.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.720
Don't you think she'd fight harder
if her dad came to visit?

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:11.320
I wasn't worried, just curious.
So don't overreact.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.490
Kim Sun Jae.
You really are a hopeless case.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.900
This could be your last chance
to turn all of this around.

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:24.670
No, I'm in way too deep to go back.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.370
Don't say that.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.710
Instead, work with me...

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.710
to give Chairman Min's slush fund ledger
to the prosecutors and make him pay.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.950
And what happens to me then?

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.620
Min Doo Sik has nothing but money
to throw around...

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.820
and will slip through
the cracks of the law,

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:41.850
but I can't.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.090
All I did was follow their orders
like a dog.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.520
I'll be the one to take the blame
for the ledger,

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.030
not Chairman Min, who created the fund.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:51.560
And you want me to do
something that stupid?

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.800
Then how much longer
are you going to live like this?

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.630
You know how this is all going to end,
don't you?

00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:01.370
You've really grown a spine
now that you have the chairman's stake.

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.070
But what a shame.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.080
It's not over until it's over, right?

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.580
This game isn't over yet.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.550
Don't act as if you've already won.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:26.830
And at that time,

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.870
I was the one...

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.500
who saved your dying daughter.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.240
If you're curious about your daughter,

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:38.680
just say the word.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.050
I'll tell you where she is.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:48.050
But Manager Gong
definitely told me she died.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:05.340
Where is...

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.770
that child now?

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.310
I'll send you the address.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:49.980
(The late Baek Mi So)

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:12.540
Baek Mi So.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.010
That's...

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.040
your daughter's name.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.610
This can't be.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.390
Why is she here?

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.760
She'd barely be 20 years old...

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:39.760
Who did this to her?

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.370
Who did this to her?

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:45.870
Tell me who it was!

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.610
You don't remember, do you?

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.510
At the tender age of 16,

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:58.420
Mi So jumped from the rooftop
of Mingang Distribution...

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:02.190
four years ago.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.960
(The late Baek Mi So)

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.940
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.060
