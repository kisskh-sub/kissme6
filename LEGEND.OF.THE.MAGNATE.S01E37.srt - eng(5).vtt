[Episode 37]

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.950
I thought to myself back then

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.390
even if it meant falling into hell
and never getting out,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.640
I couldn't stay poor.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.680
Father!

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.520
You told me...

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.910
your mother has forgiven me.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.660
What about you?

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.079
I pity you.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.000
Father.

Father.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.120
If you don't want to stay here,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.390
you can go down the mountain too.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.160
Father...

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.090
Let's go down the mountain together.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.920
You don't need to care about these things.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.590
Father.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.000
Look.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.680
You and I—

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.190
aren't we doing just fine?

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.630
That bastard Gu

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.720
and that crazy woman—

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.420
we don't even know them.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.630
He's just

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.490
an exile from Ningguta,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.150
a dirt‑poor tea farmer.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.480
But you're Li Million.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.510
You are...

Father.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.159
You're the wealthiest man

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.659
in the capital's business world,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.060
a businessman with a red official's hat

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.120
who is trusted by the imperial court.

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.750
Father.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.950
Forget all of this.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.680
Just be my father, and mine alone.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.390
Alright, Father?

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.450
Let's go down the mountain.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.400
A mistake this big
is too much to make even once,

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.240
let alone twice.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.310
Now do you see

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.000
why I didn't let you

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.630
associate with that Gu?

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.800
Child,

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.070
you truly are clever,

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.600
but far too competitive.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.780
The family wealth I'm leaving you

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.200
is enough for you
to live a lifetime in comfort.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.890
Don't go into business.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.120
Go back to the capital

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.690
and do whatever you want except that.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.400
Father...

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.160
You want me to go back alone?

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.270
I don't have the strength

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.800
to step out this door.

was heaven's will.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.159

and atone.

The person who set me up
in the imperial examination back then

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.120
was you.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.700
I knew you came to the capital.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.930
I was afraid
if you really passed the exam,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.720
the show couldn't go on.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.270
You just think I can't

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.800
compete with Gu Pingyuan.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.260
You underestimate me.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.830
Let me make a bet with you.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.160
I'll compete with him fairly

in business.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.510
When I crush him

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.480
and make his entire family

disappear,

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.450

I want to make a deal with you.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.130
I'm just a small merchant.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.240
How dare I do business with you?

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.510
You must be joking.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.820
Am I joking with you,

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.910
or are you joking with me?

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.240
I heard your father

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.480
became a monk
and is now living in seclusion.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.750
You're in charge now.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:27.980
How about this?

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.360
However much your family

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.840
spent on the salt fields,

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.210

The Li family invested so much money

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.550
in Liangjiang region.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.120
Do you expect us

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.280
to just obediently go back
because you say so?

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.480
The Li family's business

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.240
doesn't belong solely to us.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.440
If you want to get your hands on it,

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.770
you should first ask the others involved.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.130
Stop trying to intimidate me
with big names.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.080
Indeed.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.630
I know your Li family

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.600
has the Sixth Prince's capital behind it.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.000
But when it comes to the livelihood
of Liangjiang region

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.390
and the imperial court's tax revenue,

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.120
even if His Highness were here,

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.910
I doubt he could protect you.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.440
Let me remind you of something:

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.300
the one I invited was your father,

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.510
not you, a little nobody.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.820
Everyone abandons a sinking ship.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.020
Without your father,

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.320
do you think
the Sixth Prince will still shield you?

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.480
As for the business in Liangjiang,

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.030
it has nothing to do with your Li family.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.080
Since your father has retired,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.260
you should go back now.

our previous bet no longer counts?

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.320
You really thought you would win?

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.150
Why don't you take a look at the accounts?

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.840

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.750
is slightly superior.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.740
Actually, I have some

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.360
rough ideas

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.780
and would like to hear your thoughts.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.040
I've been thinking,

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.520
people consume salt

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.480
in limited quantities, right?

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.320
You can't possibly eat salt

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.120
as your main food for every meal.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.240
We already have enough

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.200
salt shops now.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.680
Opening another one

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.690
would at most

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.480
take a bigger slice
of the market's profits.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.390
It's not a wise move

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.850
and not worth doing.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.960
The problem is Li

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.550
has already come knocking.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.920
With his abundant capital,

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.870
if we open one new shop,

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.270
he can open two next door.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.400
What should we do?

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:24.450
Do we have to

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.930
lower our prices again?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.120
-Yeah.
-We can't do that.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.120
A price war

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.790
is just a desperate measure.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:30.720
If we continue this war like this,

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.980
everyone will end up losing everything.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.610
That's no longer business.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.210
It's just being stubborn.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.790
Besides,

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.250
I can't keep this up much longer.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.710

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:48.490

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.000
It's okay, Mother.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.140
I'll have your son buy me another one.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.480
Yu'er.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.870
Let me.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.010
Mother still refuses to drink it.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.480
Mother,

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.750
I had someone bring

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.480
goose‑fat cakes for you from Jiangning.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.910
Take your medicine first,

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.550
and then you can have the cakes.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.150
I'm not a child.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.720
Why bother coaxing me?

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:35.460
If something is bothering you,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.910
just tell me.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:38.550
But you must

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.780
take the medicine.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.270
Pingyuan,

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.510
help me up.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.070
Let me sit for a while.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.550
Why do you look so pale?

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.240
Are you stunned?

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.200
There's been too much going on lately.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.090
Pingwen scolded me,

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.320
saying I never should have

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.720
taken you away from home,

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.240
and that I've only harmed you
by doing this.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.750
I think he had a point.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.240
If I hadn't insisted
on going to the capital

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.470
for the imperial examination back then,

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.330
none of this would have happened.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.120
Were you ever in control?

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:39.720
There's no immortal

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.980
who tells us

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.660
what we're supposed to do.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:46.320
If I had known

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.840
he would never return,

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.480
I wouldn't have let him go.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.710
Wouldn't that have solved everything?

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.200
But what's the point

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.440
of saying this now?

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:58.910
It's all fate.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.080
Even if fate really exists,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.640
I'm going to fight it.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:08.200
Mother,

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.109
you must stay well.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.589
One day you'll have

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.170
grandchildren.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:18.050
You still have
a long, long life ahead of you.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.069
You can't just let go.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.510
Be honest with me.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:30.830
Do you want

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.400
that man to come back

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.920
to see you?

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:38.960
If you do,

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.560
no matter how I feel about it,

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.830
I can go beg him—

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.470
I can go kneel to him

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.070
and kowtow to him—

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.550
as long as it makes you happy,

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:48.550
I'll do anything.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.540
What would I want him back for?

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.690
All my life,

00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.350
I've been holding on

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.550
to this one thing—

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.140
I never knew if he was dead or alive,

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.090
where he died,

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.350
and whether his remains

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:10.920
were left out

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:12.350
in the wind and rain.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.110
But as you've seen,

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.030
he's living just fine,

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.770
even changed his surname.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.480
Isn't that

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.510
the biggest joke on me?

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:26.920
Pingyuan,

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.560
now that I've finally
let go of this burden,

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.480
I feel empty inside.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.480
No medicine can fix that.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.200
Just let me be.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.400
No.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.320
You can't think that way.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.700
That man changed his name,

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.010
and his heart changed too.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.090
The person you've been waiting for

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.350
died on his way

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:00.790
to the imperial examination.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.070
He is a dead man now.

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:03.680
But we are still alive.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.200
We can't let a dead man

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.310
trample over us,

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:09.160
can we?

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.880
Pingwen.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.860
Why do you have to be angry with me?

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.590
Take good care of Mother

00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:59.720
these next few days.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.370
I'm going on a trip.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.440
Where are you going?

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.760
I'm going to Jinshan Temple.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.010
Are you going to bring him back

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.280
or acknowledge him as your father?

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.200
It's too late.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:21.510
He has a son now.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.750
And you, Gu Pingyuan,

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.000
are nothing to him.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.770
You think hiding away solves everything?

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.440
I've seen enough of the past,

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:09.750
and I don't want to look at what's ahead.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:49.440
Kid...

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:50.550
Don't call me kid!

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.250
Your kid is down the mountain.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.540
Seeing how devoted you are to your mother

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.310
makes me feel gratified.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:22.790
When I saw her that day,

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:23.960
I knew

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.260
the dream had to end.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.830
I couldn't keep pretending anymore.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.440
What do you mean by that?

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.120
You don't want to deal with anything
anymore?

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.700
I won't hold it against you

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.280
how you wronged me back then.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.710
But now my mother's life
is hanging by a thread,

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.940
and she won't even take her medicine.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.160
As her son,

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.960
I don't know how to persuade her.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:50.960
I just hope

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.920
you can go see her

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.820
and say something, anything,

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.990
to ease her heart

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.570
so she can keep living.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.120
What did your mother say?

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.140
She said now that she's finally seen you,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.600
her wish has been fulfilled,

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.580
and she doesn't have the strength

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.880
to hold on.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.110
What should I say to her?

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.590
How should I say it?

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:42.880
Indeed.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.000
It seem

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.590
you've never regretted

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:50.850
a single thing you did.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.110
You really are shameless.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.570
I told my mother,

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.180
"You don't need to wait for him anymore."

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.000
"He died long ago,"

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.850
"on the road to the capital"

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.740
"for the imperial examination."

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.690
"That man is dead,"

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:15.430
"and his heart has changed."

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:43.070
Well said.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:47.400
Well said.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:01.000
Well said.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:05.430
Pingyuan?

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.130
Why are you back so late?

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.590
Mother?

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.360
Are you feeling better now?

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.200
I dreamed about him last night.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:00.880
He was standing at the door,

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.880
right there,

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.240
just like the day

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.350
he left,

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.380
with his backpack on his back,

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:20.000
his basket in hand,

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:24.880
and inside were brush, ink, inkstone,

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.110
and the rice balls I made for him.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.880
He said to me...

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:33.270
He said,

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.240
"I failed the exam."

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.270
I told him,

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:38.880
"So what?"

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.350
"Our son has made something of himself."

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.750
"Isn't that even happier news"

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:46.400
"than you passing the exam?"

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.070
He said he was tired

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.400
and wanted to sleep a little,

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.930
and that's when I knew he was dead.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.830
He regretted it after all.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.030
Yes.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:12.790
He regretted it.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.350
He said

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.060
he really wanted to come back.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:32.070
So I didn't wait for nothing.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.920
There's so much temptation

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.480
out there in the world.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.340
You took a wrong turn

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.350
but still managed to come back—

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.400
that's a blessing.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:55.640
How did he die?

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.790
He...

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.000
he just died,

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:04.240
without pain.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.270
I know that, of course.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.940
What's wrong with you?

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.680
I...

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.480
I haven't been feeling well
these past few days.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.310
Yesterday I went to see the doctor.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.790
This morning,

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.450
when I went to get my medicine,

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.550
he told me...

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:28.540
I'm pregnant.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.380
What are you doing? Are you stunned?

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:43.920
Yu'er,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.800
go back to your room now and rest.

When I recover,

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.150
I'll help you take care of the baby.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.200
Mother is right.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.640
Come on, let me help you back.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.640
I don't need your help.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.780
I can walk on my own.

Mother.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.720
Go and ask

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.440
who examined her pulse.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:04.110
Well...

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:04.880
You...

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.840
Thank you.

Why didn't I

stay longer in her room?

she was smiling.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:56.440
it was her time to go,

and that she didn't suffer.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:04.710
That was the result of the blessings
she accumulated in her life.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.590
As her children,

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.220
we should be happy for her.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.710

issue the reward money,

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:33.690
and in your name,

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.130
wrote a thank-you note.

who have been working

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:39.150
for the Old Master

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.540
want to ask you a few questions in person.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:42.840
Do you have time to see them?

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.630
I don't.

If they want to ask questions,

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.920
tell them to go ask the Old Master

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.150
in the underworld.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.760
today,

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.810
you really can't yell at me.

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.920
I've already
written my resignation letter.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.480
After the seven days of mourning,

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.810
I'll retire and go home.

You can run it however you like.

But the Old Master's spirit
hasn't left yet,

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.970
and I can't ignore my responsibility.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.020
I worked for him my whole life,

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:29.130
and I don't want to leave things
unfinished.

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:39.360
send some funeral gifts?

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.020
The Old Master made mistakes—

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.830
it's not my place to say that—

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:44.480
but he did

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.010
feel regret before he died.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.770
Sending something over

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.440
would fulfill his last wish.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.260
You're quite thoughtful.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:00.480
So tell me,

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.160
do you think my father was wrong?

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.230
If he was wrong,

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.800
that means he shouldn't have married

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:13.880
into our Li family.

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:16.190
And if he hadn't,

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:20.030
I wouldn't have been born.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.150
What did I do wrong?

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.190
Why do all of you

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:29.230
hate me so much?

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:39.990
Do you have anything else to say?

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.730
The Salt Industry Guild

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:44.110
asked you to go for the account review.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:45.040
Account review?

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.990
What account?

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.370
Back then you and Mr. Gu

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.160
made a wager for 6 months.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:52.400
There's one month left.

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:53.670
I told them you'd go

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.800
after the seven-day mourning period.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.440
Is Gu Pingyuan ready

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.630
to hand it over?
