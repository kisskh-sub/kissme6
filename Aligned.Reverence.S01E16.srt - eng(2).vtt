(Xiao Manor)

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.380
Has news from Liangzhou arrived?

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.620
Yes. Liangzhou is suffering
a severe drought.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.619
Prefect Jiang Liantang
concealed it from the court.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.540
Bandits have risen
in revolt because of it.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.420
The disaster can no longer be hidden.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.820
Young Lady Su.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.740
I came today

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.660
to ask you to keep your promise.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.580
These are all the grains we purchased.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.540
And what about your promise
to me, Your Lordship?

00:01:47.862 --> 00:01:49.222
At this morning's court assembly,

00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:50.711
His Majesty has appointed me

00:01:50.712 --> 00:01:52.540
General of Relief and Pacification.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.020
I depart tomorrow.

00:01:55.537 --> 00:01:57.657
I only thought you
would handle disaster relief,

00:01:58.125 --> 00:01:59.932
but now you must also quell rebellion.

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:04.786
Disaster relief
wins the people's hearts,

00:02:04.787 --> 00:02:05.947
and quelling the rebellion

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.340
secures military power.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.700
You said once

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.180
this would be
Xiao Manor's greatest chance.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.100
A fine account indeed.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.340
Young Lady Su.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.536
My residence

00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:29.380
lacks a mistress like you.

00:02:31.487 --> 00:02:32.936
Would you consider it?

00:02:32.937 --> 00:02:33.897
Qi Sheng.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.139
Relief affairs are settled.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.340
You may leave now.

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:40.685
Yan.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.420
I mean what I say.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.859
Young Lady Su is in her prime,

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.220
gentle and capable.

00:02:46.387 --> 00:02:48.760
If she keeps watch over
your brother's tablet for a lifetime,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.867
would it not be a pity?

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.550
Young Lady Su,

00:02:56.825 --> 00:02:58.625
give it some serious thought.

00:02:58.687 --> 00:03:00.059
We have been

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.139
through much together,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.259
we know each other well.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.580
Your Lordship, mind your words.

00:03:03.912 --> 00:03:06.072
I will forever
be the wife of Xiao Yunxi.

00:03:15.525 --> 00:03:19.499
(Xiao Manor)

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.499
Yan.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.460
You must return safely.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.700
Take good care.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.300
Yan, we will wait for you to come home.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.870
Travel safely.

00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:42.482
(Xiao Manor)

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.500
Let us go.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.700
Let us go.

00:04:07.075 --> 00:04:10.232
(Xiao Manor)

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.695
(Xiao Manor)

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.060
Xie Yunyan.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.620
Xie Yunyan.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.180
I thought you would not come.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.340
Xie Yunyan.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.860
Stay well.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.620
Come back safe.

00:05:10.637 --> 00:05:12.157
I will wait for you at home.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.980
Alright.

00:05:40.275 --> 00:05:46.286
(Xiao Manor)

00:05:46.287 --> 00:05:48.286
Su Jinyuan. You ruined my entire family.

00:05:48.287 --> 00:05:49.139
I will kill you.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.074
Su Xinyue.

00:05:50.075 --> 00:05:51.739
What nonsense are you spouting again?

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.819
If you had not
seized the Su family's property,

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.180
I would never have pushed
my parents to hoard grain.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.539
My mother would not have
borrowed from lenders.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.460
And they would not have been arrested.

00:06:01.162 --> 00:06:02.540
If they die,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.557
you will be buried with them.

00:06:05.812 --> 00:06:07.524
Was it I who told you to drive up prices

00:06:07.525 --> 00:06:08.925
and profit off disaster?

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.220
I will kill you.

00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:17.957
(Xiao Manor)

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.260
Are you alright?

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.545
How about her? Do you want
to report it to the authorities?

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.582
Forget it.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.859
Right now,

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.740
she is suffering more than death itself.

00:06:34.812 --> 00:06:35.986
Thank you, Sir.

00:06:35.987 --> 00:06:37.547
May I know the name of my rescuer?

00:06:46.675 --> 00:06:48.211
Sir.

00:06:48.212 --> 00:06:49.379
I cannot explain why,

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.100
but you feel familiar to me.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.180
I'm leaving.

00:06:57.037 --> 00:06:59.595
(Xiao Manor)

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.380
Xiao Yunxi.

00:07:12.912 --> 00:07:14.912
If you truly
cannot let go of Su Jinyuan,

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.060
take off your mask and face her.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.140
Being able to watch over her

00:07:27.587 --> 00:07:28.699
is already enough for me.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.557
You...

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.459
Every time,

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.300
it feels like punching cotton.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.180
Apothecary.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.300
Is the ginseng soup
Physician Xi mentioned ready?

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.420
It is ready.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.507
Sir.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.700
It was you, was it not?

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.300
Soak it first.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.299
This is burn ointment.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.099
Apply it quickly,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.140
and it will not hurt.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.460
Why are you so familiar
with our kitchen?

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.619
Just now,

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.340
your servants told me where things were.

00:08:52.137 --> 00:08:53.457
Who are you really?

00:08:54.687 --> 00:08:55.936
I am merely

00:08:55.937 --> 00:08:57.617
an ugly medicine servant,

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.232
Madam, please have propriety.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:07.979
The baby is born.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.820
Third Young Madam has given birth.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.379
Yunxuan, you are an aunt now.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:27.899
I am an aunt.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.339
I am an aunt.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.700
Look how happy you are.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.659
Young Madam, I am an aunt now.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.739
So handsome.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.860
The child was safely born.

00:09:36.247 --> 00:09:37.486
We must thank Young Madam,

00:09:37.487 --> 00:09:39.340
for bringing Physician Xi
to our house back then.

00:09:41.587 --> 00:09:42.627
Young Madam.

00:09:42.637 --> 00:09:44.837
Please give the child a name.

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:53.925
This generation of the Xiao family
carries the character Jing.

00:09:54.087 --> 00:09:55.286
How about calling him

00:09:55.287 --> 00:09:56.487
Jingyi?

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.019
Meaning a peaceful life

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.260
filled with ease.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.940
Jingyi sounds lovely.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.445
Jingyi.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.739
A fine name.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.660
Yes.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.460
I will add it
to the family record later.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.299
Our Xiao family is lively again.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.139
Good.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.386
Send Yan another letter.

00:10:15.387 --> 00:10:17.019
Tell him this good news.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.579
I will write it.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.299
Go on.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.860
Look how happy she is.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.545
(May Yan stay safe. Third Young Madam
bore a healthy son today.)

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.365
Young Master. There is news
on the private salt case.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.340
The overseer
of Xianyang Shipping Bureau,

00:10:48.375 --> 00:10:49.415
Wen Zhihu.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.749
End it quickly.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.390
Once these bandits are cleared,

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:57.870
I want to go home.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.220
(All is well
upon receiving your letter.)

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.179
(My journey in Liangzhou
has gone smoothly.)

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.700
(I am safe and sound.)

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.624
(The scenery of Liangzhou)

00:11:34.625 --> 00:11:36.120
(is very different from the capital.)

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.060
(If there is a chance,
I must take you here to see it.)

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.499
(I have enclosed
some local specialties of Liangzhou.)

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.620
(Try them and see if you like them.)

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.059
(Here is a Fire Jade stone
unique to Liangzhou,)

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.580
(made into a bracelet for you.)

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.259
(I may return later than planned,)

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.740
(so do not worry about me.)

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.940
I brought you
some newly released tea leaves.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.299
What a beautiful bracelet.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.220
It must be from Yan.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.460
Rou.

00:12:39.737 --> 00:12:41.932
I made a new outfit for Yi.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.220
Thank you, Young Madam.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.420
Your needlework is amazing.

00:12:48.825 --> 00:12:51.225
Yan should be back soon.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.920
Yi has yet to meet his little uncle.

00:12:53.972 --> 00:12:56.211
I hope he grows quickly

00:12:56.212 --> 00:12:57.812
and becomes like his uncle,

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.980
the pillar of the Xiao family.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.580
Yan, you are back.

00:13:15.737 --> 00:13:16.897
What is wrong?

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:34.740
Yan.

00:13:41.937 --> 00:13:47.197
♪Even the gentlest waves
