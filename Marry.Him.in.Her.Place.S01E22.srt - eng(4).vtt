Yun.

00:01:23.232 --> 00:01:24.711
Help me set another place.

00:01:24.712 --> 00:01:25.271
Yes.

00:01:25.272 --> 00:01:25.991
Young Madam.

00:01:25.992 --> 00:01:27.272
What did you call her?

00:01:27.432 --> 00:01:28.031
Young...

00:01:28.032 --> 00:01:30.311
Young Madam asked us to call her that.

00:01:30.312 --> 00:01:31.311
Father.

00:01:31.312 --> 00:01:33.351
I am Zhichu's wife.

00:01:33.352 --> 00:01:35.312
Naturally, I'm the Young Madam
of the Song family.

00:01:36.632 --> 00:01:38.352
I've already instructed the servants

00:01:38.592 --> 00:01:39.952
to prepare a room for me.

00:01:40.472 --> 00:01:42.351
And informed everyone in the household.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:45.231
Before Zhichu's hundred-day memorial,

00:01:45.232 --> 00:01:47.832
I will be staying here properly.

00:01:49.992 --> 00:01:51.951
Zhichu is gone.

00:01:51.952 --> 00:01:53.351
So I will

00:01:53.352 --> 00:01:55.072
take good care of you for him.

00:02:07.872 --> 00:02:09.112
Thank you.

00:02:10.832 --> 00:02:12.431
Thank me for what?

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:15.311
For reminding me to act
more convincingly

00:02:15.312 --> 00:02:17.271
to play the Young Madam
of the Song family well,

00:02:17.272 --> 00:02:19.791
to let everyone know I'm living here

00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:21.440
and to reassure the Liang family.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.431
It's essentially my
"I won't commit suicide" notice.

00:02:23.432 --> 00:02:25.031
If anything happens to me,

00:02:25.032 --> 00:02:27.071
everyone will naturally think

00:02:27.072 --> 00:02:29.152
it must be related to the Song family.

00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:36.631
I just don't want you to die so easily.

00:02:36.632 --> 00:02:38.992
Keep your wretched little life,

00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:43.232
so I can torture you slowly.

Is Madam Liu, who cleans
the master's study honest?

00:04:57.592 --> 00:04:59.111
Madam Lu is a good person.

00:04:59.112 --> 00:05:00.991
She just has a troublesome son.

00:05:00.992 --> 00:05:01.791
He gambles all day.

00:05:01.792 --> 00:05:03.551
When he loses, he asks her for money.

00:05:03.552 --> 00:05:05.271
Madam Lu is really pitiful.

00:05:05.272 --> 00:05:07.231
If he doesn't get money, he hits her.

00:05:07.232 --> 00:05:07.951
But

00:05:07.952 --> 00:05:09.831
I haven't seen him for months.

00:05:09.832 --> 00:05:11.911
Madam Lu said she gave him a large sum.

00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:14.071
Enough to keep him quiet for a while.

00:05:14.072 --> 00:05:15.191
I don't know whether

00:05:15.192 --> 00:05:17.391
she gave him all her funeral savings.

00:05:17.392 --> 00:05:19.231
It was months ago...

00:05:19.232 --> 00:05:21.632
Around the time you
married Young Master.

00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:24.391
Sorry, Young Madam.

00:05:24.392 --> 00:05:25.231
It's fine.

00:05:25.232 --> 00:05:26.311
You may go.

00:05:26.312 --> 00:05:26.711
Yes.

00:05:26.712 --> 00:05:27.712
Young Madam.

00:05:40.112 --> 00:05:41.592
Put it back.

00:05:42.952 --> 00:05:44.072
Put what back?

00:05:44.112 --> 00:05:45.632
Playing dumb, are you?

00:05:46.462 --> 00:05:48.742
You've become a thief
in the Song family?

00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:51.832
Why did you steal
the donation agreement?

00:05:53.752 --> 00:05:55.831
What? Protecting the Liang family
isn't enough,

00:05:55.832 --> 00:05:57.632
now you want to uphold justice too?

00:05:58.072 --> 00:06:00.592
Should I make you the president
of the Rong City Chamber of Commerce?

00:06:01.272 --> 00:06:02.471
Liang Yi.

00:06:02.472 --> 00:06:04.351
Have I been too nice to you?

00:06:04.352 --> 00:06:05.711
You people are the shameless ones.

00:06:05.712 --> 00:06:06.832
Speak.

00:06:07.272 --> 00:06:08.671
Where did you hide it?

00:06:08.672 --> 00:06:09.711
I don't know.

00:06:09.712 --> 00:06:10.712
Search yourself.

00:06:15.072 --> 00:06:16.072
Lin Yun.

00:06:16.872 --> 00:06:18.631
I am your sister-in-law now.

00:06:18.632 --> 00:06:20.271
Your brother just died.

00:06:20.272 --> 00:06:23.151
And you dare lay hands
on your sister-in-law?

00:06:23.152 --> 00:06:24.272
How outrageous.

00:06:25.272 --> 00:06:27.432
Do you think I'd still
be interested in you?

00:06:28.472 --> 00:06:30.151
Right now,

00:06:30.152 --> 00:06:32.272
you only disgust me.

00:06:36.872 --> 00:06:39.511
Find something for me.
Then I'll return the agreement to you.

00:06:39.512 --> 00:06:42.111
What right do you have
to bargain with me?

00:06:42.112 --> 00:06:43.272
You have no choice.

00:06:44.152 --> 00:06:46.111
Before I burn that agreement,

00:06:46.112 --> 00:06:47.632
you'd better hurry.

00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:53.275
Found it at the pawnshop.

00:07:01.672 --> 00:07:03.272
What did the pawnshop say?

00:07:04.152 --> 00:07:05.832
A gambler pawned it.

00:07:08.212 --> 00:07:09.299
What is this?

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.512
Why do you want it?

00:07:12.552 --> 00:07:13.871
It's none of your business.

00:07:13.872 --> 00:07:14.951
Take what you want

00:07:14.952 --> 00:07:16.370
and leave.

(Donation Agreement: Liang's Apothecary
Donee: Lin Yun)

00:08:20.152 --> 00:08:21.231
Master Liang,

00:08:21.232 --> 00:08:22.911
I was blinded by greed

00:08:22.912 --> 00:08:24.231
and stole your belongings.

00:08:24.232 --> 00:08:25.511
Please forgive me.

00:08:25.512 --> 00:08:26.351
Don't be hard on me.

00:08:26.352 --> 00:08:27.311
Please spare me.

00:08:27.312 --> 00:08:28.831
I know I was wrong.

00:08:28.832 --> 00:08:30.511
Every grievance has its cause.

00:08:30.512 --> 00:08:32.031
Your death has nothing to do with me.

00:08:32.032 --> 00:08:34.952
Please don't come after me.

00:08:36.232 --> 00:08:37.991
How did my father's thumb ring
end up with you?

00:08:37.992 --> 00:08:39.072
Who?

00:08:44.072 --> 00:08:45.991
Miss Liang?

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:48.231
Why are you here?

00:08:48.232 --> 00:08:50.431
What do you know?

00:08:50.432 --> 00:08:51.911
I...

00:08:51.912 --> 00:08:53.551
You'd better tell the truth,

00:08:53.552 --> 00:08:55.512
or I'll take your life.

00:08:57.232 --> 00:08:57.631
I...

00:08:57.632 --> 00:08:59.351
I'll speak.

00:08:59.352 --> 00:09:02.831
That day was your wedding
with Young Master Zhichu.

00:09:02.832 --> 00:09:04.431
Master came home early.

00:09:04.432 --> 00:09:06.471
He said he drank too much that night.

00:09:06.472 --> 00:09:08.911
I worried he might feel unwell
at midnight,

00:09:08.912 --> 00:09:10.631
so I brought him sobering soup.

00:09:10.632 --> 00:09:12.111
Who knew

00:09:12.112 --> 00:09:14.952
I heard arguing from inside.

00:09:15.072 --> 00:09:15.911
Don't worry,

00:09:15.912 --> 00:09:17.791
I would never cover for him.

00:09:17.792 --> 00:09:20.952
But it was the children's big day.

00:09:21.872 --> 00:09:23.792
Are you sure it was my father inside?

00:09:24.792 --> 00:09:25.952
Yes, it was Master Liang.

00:09:26.472 --> 00:09:28.112
What else did you hear?

00:09:28.272 --> 00:09:30.751
I heard Master Liang cry out,

00:09:30.752 --> 00:09:32.591
then it went quiet.

00:09:32.592 --> 00:09:33.591
I didn't dare enter,

00:09:33.592 --> 00:09:35.192
so I left.

00:09:35.472 --> 00:09:37.592
What about the thumb ring?

00:09:37.752 --> 00:09:40.751
The next day, I cleaned Master's room

00:09:40.752 --> 00:09:42.751
and found red stains on the floor.

00:09:42.752 --> 00:09:45.351
Master said it was spilled ink

00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:46.912
and told me to clean it.

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:48.871
But I thought

00:09:48.872 --> 00:09:50.472
it was blood.

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:55.512
I found this thumb ring under the desk.

00:09:55.792 --> 00:09:58.112
I got greedy for a moment...

00:09:58.352 --> 00:10:00.551
How did you know it belonged
to my father?

00:10:00.552 --> 00:10:03.791
There was blood on it before.

00:10:03.792 --> 00:10:07.311
Later I heard Master Liang
died that night.

00:10:07.312 --> 00:10:09.770
So I guessed.

00:10:10.472 --> 00:10:11.831
Did Song Zhichu return that night?

00:10:11.832 --> 00:10:13.449
No.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:15.992
Young Master stayed at your residence.

00:10:16.232 --> 00:10:17.831
(Song Ming.)

00:10:17.832 --> 00:10:20.351
(You killed my father.)

00:10:20.352 --> 00:10:23.231
(Hiding behind your son,
manipulating everything.)

00:10:23.232 --> 00:10:26.271
(I've been deceived by you father
and son for so long.)

00:10:26.272 --> 00:10:27.431
(Song Ming.)

00:10:27.432 --> 00:10:30.632
(I will never give up.)

00:11:15.872 --> 00:11:17.551
Such ambition.

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.751
You want to wear that uniform?

00:11:19.752 --> 00:11:22.232
I wonder if Commander Jin agrees.

00:11:26.312 --> 00:11:29.432
(I must find evidence
that Song Ming killed my father.)

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.850
Still not giving up?

00:11:45.992 --> 00:11:47.391
What are you doing?

00:11:47.392 --> 00:11:49.191
I...

00:11:49.192 --> 00:11:51.672
Just wanted to help you tidy up.

00:11:53.152 --> 00:11:54.671
Liang Yi.

00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:56.512
You're clever.

00:11:56.792 --> 00:11:58.672
I've already spared your life.

00:11:59.025 --> 00:12:01.271
Don't push your luck.

00:12:01.272 --> 00:12:03.951
If I hadn't exchanged Lin Yun back then,

00:12:03.952 --> 00:12:05.336
you would never have spared me.

00:12:05.337 --> 00:12:07.431
Don't mention that deal.

00:12:07.432 --> 00:12:09.031
You set me up.

00:12:09.032 --> 00:12:11.151
You already knew Lin Yun was my son.

00:12:11.152 --> 00:12:12.872
You used him on purpose.

00:12:13.275 --> 00:12:16.215
Quite a clever plan you had.

00:12:16.512 --> 00:12:18.472
I saw through it.

00:12:19.025 --> 00:12:21.231
Remember your first day back
in Rong City?

00:12:21.232 --> 00:12:23.031
You came to my office.

00:12:23.032 --> 00:12:25.951
I told you how to explain things
to others.

00:12:25.952 --> 00:12:29.392
I said you and Lin Yun would
call each other aunt and nephew.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.436
You showed no surprise at all.

00:12:32.437 --> 00:12:35.957
Instead, you looked relieved.

00:12:36.752 --> 00:12:39.472
Because you had already made it public.

00:12:40.032 --> 00:12:41.152
To whom?

00:12:43.872 --> 00:12:44.631
Miss Liang.

00:12:44.632 --> 00:12:46.712
How did Mr. Lin handle it?

00:12:47.037 --> 00:12:49.072
You mean the second young master?

00:12:49.632 --> 00:12:52.152
I specifically had the secretary
mention him to you.

00:12:52.432 --> 00:12:54.551
But if you didn't know,

00:12:54.552 --> 00:12:56.751
wouldn't you be completely confused?

00:12:56.752 --> 00:12:58.431
When I mentioned "aunt and nephew",

00:12:58.432 --> 00:13:00.832
your reaction shouldn't
have been so calm.

00:13:01.137 --> 00:13:02.374
You tricked me.

00:13:02.375 --> 00:13:03.871
But I have to thank you.

00:13:03.872 --> 00:13:06.031
If you hadn't deceived him,

00:13:06.032 --> 00:13:08.391
he wouldn't have obediently
acknowledged me.

00:13:08.392 --> 00:13:12.311
Now he hates you so much.

00:13:12.312 --> 00:13:14.351
Aren't you afraid
I'll tell Lin Yun the truth?

00:13:14.352 --> 00:13:15.591
What truth?

00:13:15.592 --> 00:13:16.431
Tell him

00:13:16.432 --> 00:13:19.192
that you betrayed him to save him.

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:21.992
Would he believe that?

00:13:22.952 --> 00:13:24.631
You used his hatred for me

00:13:24.632 --> 00:13:26.791
to make him do your dirty work,

00:13:26.792 --> 00:13:28.561
just like Song Zhichu back then.

00:13:28.562 --> 00:13:29.721
Song Ming,

00:13:29.722 --> 00:13:31.561
you're unfit to be a father.

00:13:31.562 --> 00:13:33.449
What do you know?

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.271
I was helping them.

00:13:35.272 --> 00:13:36.631
The father achieves enlightenment,

00:13:36.632 --> 00:13:38.311
the son ascends.

00:13:38.312 --> 00:13:39.231
What I did

00:13:39.232 --> 00:13:41.311
would all benefit them in the future.

00:13:41.312 --> 00:13:43.631
Zhichu was useless,

00:13:43.632 --> 00:13:45.512
but Yun really showed promise.

00:13:46.687 --> 00:13:48.947
After Zhichu's hundred-day memorial,

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:51.232
you can leave.

00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:53.404
You didn't kill me?

00:13:53.405 --> 00:13:55.404
Originally I wanted to kill you.

00:13:55.405 --> 00:13:59.199
But now Yun hates you so much.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.880
Doesn't he want to keep you alive
to torment you?

00:14:02.952 --> 00:14:04.472
I've realized too.

00:14:05.072 --> 00:14:07.399
You're just a woman,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.420
what trouble could you really cause?

00:14:09.837 --> 00:14:12.837
Consider you a toy I gave him.

00:14:13.392 --> 00:14:14.512
Song Ming,

00:14:15.152 --> 00:14:17.111
the one who calculated everything

00:14:17.112 --> 00:14:18.792
is actually you, right?

00:14:38.632 --> 00:14:39.699
Why is it you?

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.340
Is everything you just said true?

00:14:42.987 --> 00:14:44.627
I don't understand what you're saying.

00:14:45.275 --> 00:14:47.475
How long are you going
to keep deceiving me?

00:14:48.072 --> 00:14:49.231
To keep me alive,

00:14:49.232 --> 00:14:50.912
you'd rather let me hate you.

00:14:51.152 --> 00:14:53.312
You really are ruthless.

00:14:55.237 --> 00:14:56.357
Liang Yi,

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.557
you love me, right?

00:14:58.992 --> 00:15:00.472
Love? What love?

00:15:00.612 --> 00:15:03.099
I knew all along about your relationship
with Song Ming.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.074
To protect myself,

00:15:04.075 --> 00:15:06.071
I came up with this compromise plan.

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:07.872
It's not as noble as you think.

00:15:08.392 --> 00:15:10.912
But now I see your true face.

00:15:11.087 --> 00:15:13.095
You really aren't worth loving at all.
