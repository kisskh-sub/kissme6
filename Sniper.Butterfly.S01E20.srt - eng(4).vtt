00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.780
Jin!

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.890
You're finally back.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.740
I missed you so much.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.840
Be careful.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.680
How's your leg?

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.790
Any better?

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.450
Much better.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.300
Sit.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.970
Come.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.300
Jin.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.230
I was about to text you

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.330
about Ms. Shen.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.610
What happened?

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.840
Her ex-husband

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.380
made a scene at Bei'ao Motors

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.970
to fight over child custody.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.500
It was really embarrassing.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.630
Some higher-ups

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.080
were unhappy with her,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.060
so they used this chance to replace her.

00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:20.870
Ms. Shen was the most professional

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.430
and efficient client

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.940
I've worked with.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.220
Now that she's gone,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.560
I'm afraid

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.460
our work with Bei'ao

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.530
won't run as smoothly.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.970
It's not her fault though.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.850
Tell me about it.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.470
It's her private matter.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.340
Let's not discuss it.

00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:39.333
Let's get back to work.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.500
Alright.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.240
Okay.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.590
For the details,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.290
follow what we discussed just now.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.400
Any comments?

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.530
- No.
- No.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.730
Good.

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:00.750
Jin, your food just arrived.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.022
I left it on your desk.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.380
Jin,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.360
that's not cool.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.333
How could you order takeout
without telling us?

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.590
We're all starving during a brainstorm,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.290
yet you order takeout for yourself.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.010
I didn't order anything.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.360
What? I didn't.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.970
You must give everyone here a share.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.730
There's even soup.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.850
It smells so good, Jin.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.930
This doesn't look like takeout.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.610
My family sent this over.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.580
Your family is so nice.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.410
My parents can't look like this.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.140
Jin.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.920
Can I try

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.850
a piece of that meat?

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.730
Go ahead.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.460
Good, right?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
This is really good.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.460
Your family is amazing.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.270
I'll pass your praise

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.020
along to him.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.170
Thank you.

this data set is fine.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.780

Wait, Sister.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.930
Wait a second.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.490
I have class today,

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.850
so I can't cook right now.

00:07:22.222 --> 00:07:23.560
But I've made something for you.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.610

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.610
Thank you.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.120
Li Wu,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.850
don't cook for me anymore.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:32.850
Why?

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.510
You've been putting

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.820
all your focus on me.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.530
You're a student,

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.730
not a cook.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.680
You should spend more time

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.490
on your studies.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.140
But it didn't affect my studies.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.460
You're working on a research project,
aren't you?

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.370
Plus your classes

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.100
and your part-time job.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.370
Your days are already packed,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.177
and you still cook for me every day.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.370
I'm really happy and grateful,

00:07:59.488 --> 00:08:01.422
but I don't want you to
wear yourself out.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.430
I know

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.360
you won't be at ease

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.820
unless I'm fully recovered,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.610
but I'm completely fine now.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.900
Don't worry.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.700
You can move back to the dorm.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.820

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.300

A date?

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.490
I'm going back to the dorm,

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.510
but keep your weekend free

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.340
for me.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.610
Let's go on a date.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.420
Are you trying to negotiate with me?

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.250
Yes?

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.220
Where are we going?

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:08.540
I'm picky.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.770
There's a stargazing camping event.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.300
I signed up for it.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.180
But I want to go with you.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.940
You ask me only after you signed up?

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.220
Fine.

00:09:24.288 --> 00:09:25.940
I'll take it as getting some fresh air.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.720
Okay. You don't need
to worry about anything.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.890
I'll plan the whole thing.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.460
Then, I'll leave it to you.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.850
I'm heading out, young man.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.960
I think

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.850
we should stick to the original plan.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.220
You two are so busy.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.200
One disappears after class,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.666
the other ignores me completely.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.910
Why is it so hard

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.180
to have a meal with you two?

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:02.500
It took me a very long time
to get a seat at this restaurant.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.770
Now it's the perfect time to go.

00:10:03.777 --> 00:10:06.460

What time are we leaving tomorrow?)

00:10:06.466 --> 00:10:07.530
I haven't finished my work.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.060
Are you coming?

00:10:09.755 --> 00:10:10.960
I'm not eating with you guys.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.540
I have plans.

You're treating.

We're signing documents.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:30.700
A lot of hassle, right?

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.490
No problem, Boss.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.080
Can we apply to hire one more person

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.960
next quarter

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.940
for our department?

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:41.850
Alright.

00:11:42.066 --> 00:11:43.010
I'll think about it.

00:11:43.155 --> 00:11:43.940

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.580
Sister, do you like him?

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.370
Then what am I?

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.970
What are you on about?

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.490
That man.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.630
I've never seen you

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:12.390
so close

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.490
to any other man.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.250
He's my boss.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:18.720
You were really rude just now,

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.540
you know?

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.370
And he...

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.490
Anyway, I could never like him,

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.060
and he wouldn't like me either.

00:12:28.444 --> 00:12:29.490
You don't believe me?

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.200
Should I call him right now

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.250
and check with him?

00:12:36.488 --> 00:12:38.044
You don't even know the full story,

00:12:38.044 --> 00:12:39.530
and you're already acting impulsive.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.990
Don't you think you're being childish?

00:12:44.311 --> 00:12:46.010
And why are you
questioning me like this?

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.460
Are we even together?

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:55.970
Forget it.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.180
I'm tired.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:58.770

Let's date.

What?

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.450
We already kissed.

No.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.440
I admit

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.500
I acted on impulse

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.610
when you confessed.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.210
But I want to tell you.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.170
My feelings for you

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.780
aren't impulsive.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.580
Since we've taken that step...

00:18:51.688 --> 00:18:52.850
I want to give it a try.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.720
Wu Fu and I

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.170
had been together since college.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.740
From dating to marriage,

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.370
everything went smoothly.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.610
I always thought

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.820
that was the peaceful life I wanted.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.780
But after we divorced,

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.170
my world

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.300
collapsed in an instant.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.020
I started doubting myself.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.170
I really thought

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.610
I would never believe in love again.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:38.890
Until you

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.070
dropped into my life

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.370
like a bomb.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.260
You lit up my world again.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:50.580
I...

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.300
I...

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:54.690
I haven't been this happy

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.020
in so long.

00:20:03.666 --> 00:20:05.266
I don't want to lie to myself anymore.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.130
Li Wu.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.300
Will you give it a try with me?

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.450
As boyfriend and girlfriend?

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:33.500
I will.

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.200
I can finally hold you

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.410
like this, Sister.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.690
I...

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:01.640
I've waited so long

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.020
for this day.

00:21:39.133 --> 00:21:40.222
Why are you looking at me?

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.850
You look really good from this angle.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.100
How come I'm only realizing now

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:49.690
how handsome

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:51.780

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.210
Go ahead.

00:29:27.244 --> 00:29:29.066
All he cares about
is his girlfriend now.

00:29:29.111 --> 00:29:29.610
Here.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.130
Get to work.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.500
Let me help you.

00:29:37.822 --> 00:29:38.890
What are you laughing at?

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.000
Firefly!

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.177
Li Wu, come here and look.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.000
Fireflies prefer

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.020
damp places.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.930
There should be more near the stream.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.650
Forget it. I don't want to
step into the water.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.350
Table for one?

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.222
I'm meeting someone.

00:32:25.222 --> 00:32:26.088
Please come in.

00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:27.133
I'll have a latte.

00:32:27.133 --> 00:32:27.480
I'm here.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:27.960
Okay.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.650
Thanks.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:30.450
Jun.

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.410
You're early.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:34.240
I happened to have something nearby,

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.850
so I came over right after.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.270
How are you?

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:39.060
Is your leg better?

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.060
I'm fine.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:41.130
It's almost healed.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.160
I'm really sorry.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.300
Things were

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.110
a mess before,

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:46.930
so I didn't get to reply
to your messages.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.060
It's okay.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.450
How about you?

00:32:49.622 --> 00:32:50.540
Is everything alright?

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.160
I left Bei'ao Motors.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.210
You heard that, right?

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.020
Yeah, I did.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.070
Honestly, after I resigned,

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:59.350
very few people cared about

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.750
how I was doing

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:01.980
or what I'm up to now.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.300
So thank you for asking.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.500
Jun, don't say that.

00:33:06.777 --> 00:33:08.440
AusStar was able to
work with Bei'ao Motors

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.850
long-term, and it's all thanks to you.

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:13.510
I always felt

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:14.200
we worked

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.100
really well together.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:16.310
I really hoped

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:17.733
we could keep working together.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.300
What are your plans now?

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:23.590
Is there anything

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:24.780
I can help with?

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.550
I also feel

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:28.260
we cooperate really well.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.030
You know

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.340
I worked at Bei'ao Motors

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.020
for many years.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:37.030
My position kept getting higher,

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:37.890
but...

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:39.350
The work

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:40.650
felt more and more restrictive.

00:33:40.933 --> 00:33:43.155
Even though I was the project manager
for many things,

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.350
the real power

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:45.820
was always with the higher-ups.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.350
Some projects

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.480
had great ideas

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.450
and creativity,

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:51.160
but if a senior executive

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.160
suddenly didn't like it,

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.260
the whole project would...

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:55.740
Thanks.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.240
The whole project would

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.170
just get banned.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:00.930
So I felt

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.170
I really

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.550
didn't want to

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.100
just be an executor anymore.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:08.110
Bei'ao couldn't give me

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.810
the space or freedom I wanted.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:11.580
Since the chance came up,

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.540
I just left.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:15.650
So,

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:17.210
I'm now

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.420
starting my own business.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:22.860
So you'd already planned this.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.070
I really admire

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.330
your courage.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:27.960
But the freedom

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.210
isn't free.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.670
Since I made this choice,

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.730
there's no turning back.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.060
I can only work hard.

00:34:35.955 --> 00:34:36.710
How about you?

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:37.540
How are things?

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.250
Nothing special.

00:34:41.355 --> 00:34:43.360
I got a new person to deal with,
so everything

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.860
has to start from scratch.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.020
I'll take some time.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.030
Honestly,

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.810
I think you should switch

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:57.440
to a company

00:34:57.444 --> 00:34:59.022
with more freedom and room to grow.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:00.500
I appreciate that, Jun.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.840
But I don't have

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.730
your resolve yet.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:05.440
What if I told you

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.880
my company needs you?

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.333
Would you be willing to help me?

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.330
I know it sounds sudden.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:13.960
To be frank,

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.400
that's why

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.130
I asked you out today.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:20.920
I can't hire

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.030
my old colleagues

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:23.730
from Bei'ao.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.730
And I was doing marketing

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.690
back then.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.000
I'm not strong

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.630
in content.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.920
But the real problem now

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.360
is that

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.130
I have many clients in talks,

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.110
but without

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:38.355
a good creative director,

00:35:38.444 --> 00:35:39.760
none of the projects

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.860
can move forward.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:43.150
I thought about it over and over.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:44.800
Among all the people I've worked with

00:35:44.822 --> 00:35:46.610
who have strong skills
and good character,

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.860
you're the only one.

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.290
So, will you think about it?

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.800
It's alright.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.480
You don't have to

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.550
give me an answer now.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:56.100
Alright?

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.380
Well,

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.360
you have

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.280
your own concerns,

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.590
and I understand that.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:03.920
After all,

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.210
every work needs

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.590
the right platform.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:08.330
With the right platform, you can grow.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.970
Just let me know when you've decided.

00:36:09.977 --> 00:36:11.280
Anyway, my company

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.610
will always be open for you.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.030
The only thing

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:16.920
I can promise is
that as long as you join me,

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.480
I'll give you

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:21.110
the most freedom
and decision-making power.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:21.730
Alright?

00:36:53.022 --> 00:36:54.550
Were you waiting outside the whole time?

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.090
Aren't you afraid of getting heatstroke?

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:56.980
It's not hot.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.460
Get in.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.460
Look at you.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.540
Do I get darker?

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.420
You look even more handsome.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.770
You grab every chance to kiss me, huh?

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.940
You started it first.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.130
Thank you.

00:38:44.466 --> 00:38:45.488
Let's see what to eat.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.650
I want this one,

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.540
this one,

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:53.690
and this one.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.800
What about you?

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.688
Anything is fine.

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:57.330
Today's on me.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:38:59.940
Sure.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.100
That's enough.

00:39:03.222 --> 00:39:04.460
What do you like to drink?

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.810
I want soda.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:08.760
Okay.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.330
Sprite.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:13.900
Sure.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.290
Okay.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:18.170
One second.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:21.730
Excuse me.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:24.730
Two Sprites.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:26.130
Menu.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.460
Thank you.

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:37.170
Your Sprite.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.500
Are you hungry?

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:49.210
No.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:00.980
No?

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:01.900
Fine.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.170
Then I'll eat everything myself.

00:40:04.288 --> 00:40:05.420
You won't get a single bite.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.940
You can just watch.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.330
Sure.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:20.980
Li Wu,

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.000
when you were little,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.770
did you ever think
you'd date an older lady?

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.770
Before I liked you,

00:40:36.911 --> 00:40:38.130
I never thought about anything.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.020
Then why do you like me?

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.710
Answer it properly.

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:10.900
Why do you like me?

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:18.650
Because I'm pretty?

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:25.980
My girlfriend

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:27.170
is very pretty.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:42.940
Thanks.

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:43.810
Please enjoy.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.500
Thank you.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.290
Here.
