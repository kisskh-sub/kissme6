[Episode 35]

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.259
It appears to me

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.390
that the gravest concern now

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.640
is that the salt prices
are remaining too low.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.039
You can't just keep

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.120
pushing yourself, can you?

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.400
I plan to procure salt

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.150
from Sichuan.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.590

Sichuan well salt

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.000
is certainly cheap,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.789
but you are

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.280
waging a price war now.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.790
Are you

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.720
looking to smuggle salt?

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.830
It's hardly smuggling,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.040
since salt is a necessity shared by all.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.940
Decades ago, such remarks

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.390
would be considered highly offensive.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.380
Don't you fear the death penalty?

from the Song Dynasty.

However, nowadays,

Then, the brine

Don't you think that's high?

Four hundred thousand?

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.810
It's actually not a large figure.

Mr. Gu, come.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.920
Let's take a picture.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.040
God of Wealth!

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.240
Coming!

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.410
Mr. Gu, your reputation

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.600
is growing by the day.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.550
In Jiangsu and Zhejiang,

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.840
your name's mentioned on a daily basis.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.030
You're really something.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.890
It feels so cool

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.240
here in your cabin.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:31.060
Cool, right?

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.290
The secret's over there.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:33.950
Take a look.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.530
What a smart way to make ice.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.190
I must say, God of Wealth,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.100
you're really living an immortal's life.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.340
That's not true.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.870
Having spiritual powers makes one a god,

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.120
and being carefree makes one an immortal.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.200
Which of those standards
do you think I've met?

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.540
Stop flattering me.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.860
Take a seat now.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.800
Have some lotus root and fruits.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.370
They've just been chilled.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.150
Settle down,

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.150
and we'll drink later.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.030
That can wait.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:13.910
Well,

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.800
have the ships arrived yet?

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.170
Look at you, so impatient.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.240
I've got them prepared for you.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.430
Exactly

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.880
16 ships.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.400
Good thing I own a draft bank

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.000
and charter ships year-round
to transport raw silk.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.130
People other than me

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.440
may not be able to secure
these many ships.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.170
In that case,

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.430
I owe you many thanks.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:37.530
Alright, alright.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.320
Be seated.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.310
I heard that recently in Liangjiang,

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.000
salt merchants have been racking

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.670
their brains

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.600
for issues regarding salt fields.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.510
I suggest you not worry too much

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.870
about winning or losing.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:53.930
At such a young age,

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:55.550
you're already a well-matched rival

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.530
for Li Million.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.840
That's a remarkable achievement itself.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.840
Even if you're forced onto the back foot,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.290
that won't be your fault.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.390
Don't let

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.210
this matter

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.670
affect your health.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.220
I've been pushed

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.840
this far by the Viceroy of Liangjiang.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.820
In fact,

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.240
Rui Lin never intended

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.890
to let Li Wantang manage
the Lianghuai salt business.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.670
He just set me up to take on the latter.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.760
What happened later—
stabilizing salt prices,

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.720
taking action against rice merchants,

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.600
and that trouble concerning the Li family—

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.060
was all instigated by him.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.210
The Viceroy of Liangjiang

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.160
is nicknamed the Wringer.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.240
Even if he saw the King of Hell,

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.440
he'd wring every last copper out of him.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.970
I must warn you of this—

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.690
stay cautious

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.980
in the salt trade.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.270
It concerns many interested parties.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.600
I've done everything

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.560
I can to help you.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:39.730
As for the rest,

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.730
I'm not sure what exactly I can do.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.630
Thank you for the kind reminder, Mr. Wu.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.270
Butler!

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.750
How's my father?

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.480
Young Master,

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.640
Master is still in a coma.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.100
The problem is I can't wait

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.050
till he comes to!

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.050
If anything goes wrong...

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.360
I'll take full responsibility.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.930
It's not your money at stake anyway.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.790
This is a very tense situation.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.670
What are you still dawdling for? Go!

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:02.120
Fine.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.480
I'll go check on Master.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.080
His Excellency

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.870
demands the salt field taxes

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.320
be paid right on time.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.610
Before I came back,

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.320
I had just settled the payment.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:16.840
The monthly

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.870
tax bill of over 400,000 taels of silver

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:19.810
is like a knife

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.370
pressed against my throat.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.370
That really...

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.570
feels awful.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.010
Alright.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.350
Enough said about me.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.600
Tell me how you've been.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.400
Any problems in doing business?

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:31.750
We're faring well

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.910
in business.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.270
The problem is

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.110
the current salt prices are far too low,

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:38.670
while the taxes are excessively high.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.360
Even if you owned a silver mine,

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.090
you'd be drained financially.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.410
I think it's time to shut down
these two silk shops

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.130
in Tianjin.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.360
They're tying up too much money,

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.020
while yielding thin profits.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.510
Young Master,

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.510
they bring in an annual revenue
of hundreds of thousands of taels.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:55.750
You call that "thin profits"?

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.030
Do you even know the meaning

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.870
of "thin profits"?

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.720
I definitely know better than you do.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.670
When these shops are closed,

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.150
and the properties
and inventory liquidated,

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.200
we'll at least gain hundreds

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.320
of thousands more taels.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:04.910
Hands off!

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.040
You can't do this!

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.080
How am I going to explain

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.320
to Master when he wakes up?

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.750
Who's in charge of the Li family now,

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:10.790
you or me?

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.250
Definitely not me.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.600
But is pouring money into this

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.330
non-stop really the solution?

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.760
I think it's better

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.120
to bribe the officials.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.390
That way,
you get to keep some money for yourself,

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.600
and things will go more smoothly.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.440
If I give this money to the officials,

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.500
will they stop taxing my salt fields?

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.440
I'm closing these two tea shops too.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.430
Young Master,

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.130
you really must not do this.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.000
You know what business

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.860
Master does.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.480
It's not worthwhile
to sustain the salt fields

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.750
at the cost
of his most significant ventures!

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.470
Doing so

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.720
will make you a...

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.270
A real spendthrift.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.000
Is it what you were going to say?

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.520
Young Master,

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.880
I didn't mean any of that.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.560
I don't care what you meant.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:57.870
Right now, every month,

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.270
I'm required to pay 400,000 taels

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.320
in salt field taxes.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.200
I have people to feed, horses to maintain,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.150
clerks to hire, managers to pay—

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.080
so many expenditures!

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.550
I'm hemorrhaging money every month.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.320
If my father wakes up and finds out

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.670
I've lost the salt fields,

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.080
what do you think he'll make of this?

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.570
I'll have to obediently

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.840
return to the capital
and study for the rest of my life.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.240
I'll never be allowed to do business

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:14.910
again!

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.120
So, I'm telling you,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.260
I must win this battle!

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.090
Understood?

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.720
Master has come to!

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.780
Master has come to!

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.840
Master has come to...

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.900
Master has come to!

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.520
Come on, drink up.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.160
No need to panic, everyone.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.360
Everything will be fine as I said.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:46.910
Boss.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:55.340
Mr. Tu,

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.780
what is this about?

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.600
Do tell us what trick you have

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.460
up your sleeve.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:03.750
Come with me.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:04.150
No, no.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.140
What are you doing?

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.270
I didn't do anything.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.470
It's not like I'm going to eat you alive.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.070
I just want to take you out

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.280
and show you the salt.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:11.840
Heizi.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.480
Father, it's me, Li Qin.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.300
Would you like some water?

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.390
Master,

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:24.870
The salt fields have been

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.670
causing financial losses to us.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.750
Why bring this up?

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.630
Come with me.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.550
My father is seriously ill.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:39.750
To save my father's life,

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.750
I'd never hesitate to forfeit

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.480
all family assets,

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.320
let alone some shops.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.850
So drop this topic for good.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.350
Lift the cloth and show them.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.080
This...

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.200
Take a good look.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.210
Put the cover back on!

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.480
Move!

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:42.900
That's a lot of salt.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.480
Yeah.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:44.550
I guess it's even more than

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:45.270
all our stock.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.270
-Indeed.
-Right.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.870
Boss,

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.140
where did this salt come from?

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.050
Tell them.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.560
This salt

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.630
wasn't sourced in Lianghuai.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.520
It's well salt
delivered from Sichuan and Yunnan

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.980
by horse gangs and waterways.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:18.630
Boss,

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:20.890
you're dealing in illegal salt.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.010
That's a capital offense.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.200
Everyone,

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.140
in business at this level,

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.000
who isn't risking his life?

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.670
In such difficult times,

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.700
working with all of you

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.000
is my honor.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.790
I was reluctant to tell you the truth

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:43.480
because I was concerned

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.070
that if the government investigated,

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.550
you would all be implicated.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:47.550
Now, I've told you

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.750
the trick I have up my sleeve.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.350
As for what path to take next,

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:52.720
please decide for yourselves.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.920
I won't force anyone.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.030
Boss,

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:57.680
we're so blessed

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.240
to be taken in by you.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.750
For that, we're truly grateful.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.170
But this matter...

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:10.690
How about this?

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.790
Let it be the last risk we take.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.030
We'll bear all potential consequences
together.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:17.560
At worst,

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.050
when we're done with this—

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.400
we'll have some savings by then—

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.070
we'll close our shops to put an end

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.930
to everything.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.160
It's unnecessary to fight Li Wantang

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.490
over short-term gains.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.730
Don't worry about that.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.310
You must be tired from the journey.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.770
Get home and get some rest.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:34.880
Tomorrow morning,

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.210
escort your boats back.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:49.920
Young Master,

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.980
there's a finding.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.560
What is it?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.200
Our men spent a long time observing

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:57.880
each salt shop

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.880
in the salt guild.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.520
They discovered that before dawn,

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.880
packs of salt carried by big ships

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.380
would arrive at the dock.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.960
Our men followed the ships

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.750
and found the salt

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:06.750
wasn't sourced locally.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.310
Most of it was well salt from Sichuan.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.920
Well salt?

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.680
How many shipments?

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.880
Deliveries were made day and night.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.940
Last time, there were 16 large ships.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.750
Well salt costs less than half of ours.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.410
No wonder they can keep going.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:21.060
I was wondering

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.710
why he dared to enter a price war with me.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.130
I'm merely hanging on

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.160
by selling shops,

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.560
while he remains unscathed.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.920
Go get the butler.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.550
Yes.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.790
When Master wakes up,

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:41.880
we'll let him decide.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.470
No need.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.270
My father is too weak now.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.750
he shouldn't be bothered
with these matters.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:47.750
Besides, he's not keeping us around

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.310
so we can be dead weight, right?

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.770
Tell me.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.200
Do you have a plan?

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.150
Gu Pingyuan smuggles a large amount

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.720
of salt at a time.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.480
This is a capital offense.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.760
Anything wrong, Young Master?

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:06.050
You want to report it to the authorities?

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.640
How foolish of you.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:11.390
Now, it is known to everyone

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.360
in Liangjiang

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.550
that Gu Pingyuan is heavily favored

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.200
by the Viceroy of Liangjiang.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.600
Who would dare touch him?

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.920
Maybe the Viceroy's Office is going to

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.180
reward him for stabilizing salt prices.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:24.860
Listen.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:27.830
To my recollection,

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.630
when we first came to Jiangning,

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.810
we sent generous gifts

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.400
to the Canal Gang, didn't we?

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.680
Now, these people have come in handy.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.010
Tell them

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.640
to seize this shipment of salt

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.830
that Gu Pingyuan is expecting

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:39.960
as soon as possible.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.350
If he boldly demands it back,

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.350
seize him too.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.120
Under such circumstances,

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.590
Gu Pingyuan won't dare
to ask the authorities for help.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.790
He'll have to swallow this bitter pill.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.480
That's the first task.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.270
Second,

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.610
notify all our shops nationwide

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.170
to transfer all their funds here.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.240
I'll finish Gu off while he's down.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.550
I don't believe I'll lose again.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.070
The time has come for Gu Pingyuan

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.270
and me to see who's better
through this salt competition.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.550
Carry out the tasks now.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.410
Stop your boats!

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.720
Halt!

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.880
Stop your boats now,

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.360
or we'll set them on fire!

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.720
Everyone,

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:52.490
what...

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.920
what's going on here?

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:57.380
[Canal Gang]

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.480
Mother.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.350
Why are your eyes so red?

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.600
Did you not sleep last night?

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:39.720
I...

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.360
I must've got so tired

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:43.940
that I fell asleep.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.720
How long have I been out?

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.260
For... over 10 days.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.260
Mother.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:57.670
Are you really awake now?

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.410
I know what happened in the past few days.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.920
You gave me bed baths

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.140
and fed me medicine.

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:14.590
Yet I just couldn't open my eyes.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.070
I wasn't even able to move

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.000
my fingers.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.240
I was like a bug

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.110
trapped in glue.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.200
I yelled "no" as loud as I could.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.380
Then I asked this guy

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.850
to at least let me

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.620
bid farewell to my family.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:41.240
He fell silent,

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.880
and I felt that I could move.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.960
Who...

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.000
was that guy?

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:53.790
Maybe he was God,

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.200
or

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.550
an educated man.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.310
Who cares who he was?

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.680
Mother.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.410
You must've had a bad dream.

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.600
Kid, you don't understand.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.240
The real bad dream is being awake.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.510
When I was asleep,

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.880
everything was clear to me.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.940
Where is Pingyuan?

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.780
He... went out for business.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.240
I need to tell you something.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.240
Listen carefully.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.160
Do not demand

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.550
a man seek fame,

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.180
as long as he's ambitious.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.980
Do not demand a man be smart,

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:02.450
as long as he's kind-hearted.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.240
In chaotic times,

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.340
being together matters more than anything.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:11.790
You get it?

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:15.760
Mother...

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.400
Why are you saying this?

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.440
When I first lied down,

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.240
I wished I could die immediately.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:33.650
I slowly came to realize everything,

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.920
but unfortunately, it was too late.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:44.900
Father,

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.790
why did you suddenly fall ill?

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.480
This is fate.

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.510
Are you and Gu Pingyuan

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.390
still neck and neck in business?

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.070
Maybe yesterday we were.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:08.760
But after today,

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:09.880
that won't be the case.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.920
I had the Canal Gang

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.960

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:14.660
You have no idea.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.110
He adopted the tactics

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.440
of illegal salt dealers

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.380
and smuggled

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.510
cheap well salt from Sichuan for sale.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.070
No wonder
he dared to wage a price war against me

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.400
and has not lost ground.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.370
Shame on him.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.880
Business is just business.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.880
What you've done is unethical.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:34.660
That...

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.980
Father,

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:36.720
why are you suddenly

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.680
talking about ethics with me?

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.160
Remember what you taught me?

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.270
One shouldn't do business

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:41.440
if he cares much about ethics.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.880
You said nothing is more important than

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.750
accomplishing what I set my mind to.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.810
Why the sudden talk about ethics now?

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.030
And where is this mercy

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.160
for him coming from?

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.440
The salt industry
is the lifeline of Lianghuai.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.800
Though it's entirely under my control now,

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.350
I've never thought of

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.000
monopolizing it.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:04.410
Neither should you ever expect that.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.640
If we cut off the livelihood of Lianghuai,

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.330
our family will become
a target of public criticism.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.240
Son,

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.080
don't go to the extremes
when you do business.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:20.000
Gu Pingyuan

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.930
isn't doing business for himself.

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:24.310
He's trying to leave Jiangnan

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.680
Capturing half of the market

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.920
is good enough for us.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.440
As for the Canal Gang...

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.440
tell them to back off right away.

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.650
We have to steer clear of trouble.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.340

get well soon

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.720
and take back

00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:59.950
the business from me.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.880
The young master's actions

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.480
are truly surprising.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.570
Haven't you noticed he's changed?

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.550
People

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.880
with a knife want to kill,

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.830
with power want to act,

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.480
and with money,

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.400
there's nowhere in the world

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.600
they don't want to go.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.880
These three things are the most dangerous.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.590
Now that he's taken over the business,

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:35.190
he would inevitably change.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.780
I've managed to step away from it all.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.200
Just let him be.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.000
Master,

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.640
you're disheartened

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.070
only because of the illness.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:48.270
When you recover, all family affairs

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:49.930
will still be yours to decide.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.000

of holding onto all this money?

Selling illegal salt

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.590
has hundreds of thousands of members.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.720
Can they be subdued by one strike only?

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.920
To avoid imminent danger,

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.630
maybe they will release Pingyuan.

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.110
But after that,
it'll be much more difficult

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:27.910
to ship items on the Grand Canal.

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:30.440
It's not like we're demanding
lost goods back now.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.840
That's the least of my concern!

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.280
Heizi said

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:34.520
they'd drown him

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:36.150
unless we paid in 3 days!

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.440
If I wait till you devise a proper plan,

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.710
it'll be too late
to even collect his body!

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:40.190
Yu'er!

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.560
T-This is a serious matter.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:44.190
I have told Pingyuan

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.810
not to deal in illegal salt!

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.330
Look what has happened.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.760
We can't report this to the authorities.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.290
Getting him back by force
is not the solution.

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.690
It's better

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.640
for us to find a mediator

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:56.110
to reconcile both sides.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.790
I know quite a few notable figures

00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.960
in the Canal Gang.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.930
I've asked someone influential

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:03.190
to speak on our behalf.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.670
What are you doing here?

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.270
You should be recuperating.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:15.370
When I left,

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.480
Gu Pingyuan asked me to find someone

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.190
to save him.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.380
I went looking but she wasn't around.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.400
I wanted to ask...

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:22.280
if I should go again.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.450
You silly child!

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:24.590
Who did he ask you to find?

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:26.320
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.030
Why are you looking at her?

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.710
Say it now!

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.920
A life is in danger!

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.360
It's a Ms. Su

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.620
in Marshal Jiu's camp.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.780
You look down on me.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.440
You look down on me, don't you?

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.230
Su can save him,

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:42.310
but I can't?

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:43.190
Are you going or not?

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.250
I will if you don't!

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:45.050
Out of my way!

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:46.290
Off you go!

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.440
Yu'er,

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.300
can't you put yourself together?

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.590
Incense smoke rises from the burner.

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:34.000
Three elders and four young masters
sit in the hall.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.880
This humble fellow offers incense

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.190
and begs for a meeting with Chief.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.030
Here I hold another burner
before my chest.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.590
The three elders and four young masters
beam with joy.

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:44.110
My mentor comes
and takes the seat of honor,

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:47.440
as this humble disciple lights incense
to pay his respects.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.920
May I have your name, sir?

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:51.360
My surname is Chang.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.590
I am the fourth child in my family.

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:53.920
Above me, it's the "Tong" generation.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.550
Below me, it's the "Wan" generation.

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:57.610
As for me, I'm in the "Wu" generation.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.030
You are a respected senior then.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.170
Could you tell me who your mentor is?

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.510
A son dare not speak his father's name.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.190
I learned from a gentleman
of the "Tong" generation.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.650
I've come with my daughter

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.360
to discuss matters about her husband.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:12.050
Please.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.480
Boss Gui,

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.840
Chang Si pays his respects to you.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.590
Mr. Chang,

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.280
the senior member of the "Tong" generation
you mentioned

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.210
has spoken to me.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.590
You're here to save your son-in-law,

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:36.720
Gu Pingyuan, right?

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.600
Yes, exactly.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.760
He smuggles salt on the Grand Canal,

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.920
but refuses

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.400
to share profits with his helpers

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.050
along the way.

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:45.310
It's unfair, isn't it?

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:46.210
What?

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.240
Do we not deserve to be paid?

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.550
But there are rules in place.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.400
My son-in-law is acting on

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.190
orders from the Viceroy of Liangjiang

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.410
to revitalize Lianghuai salt fields.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.680
He's not trading salt for private gain.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.070
Boss Gui,

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:01.890
I hope you understand.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.670
Don't try to pressure me

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:04.870
with the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.360
Those filthy rich officials

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.730
are rolling in money,

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.890
while my brothers in the Canal Gang

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.590
have to buy their own shoes

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.190
when they wear them out running.

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:14.000
If you have a complaint,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.150
take it to the authorities.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:16.320
I'd like to see who dares to interfere

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.380
when this blows up.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:19.910
The Canal Gang possesses

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:23.210
a dragon-headed scepter
awarded by Emperor Qianlong.

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:24.840
If this gets out of hand,

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.840
I don't mind

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.140
talking it out in the government office.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.960
But that senior member
of the Tong generation...

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.310
[Hall of Loyalty]

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:36.320
I have hundreds of thousands of mouths

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:36.840
to feed!

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.030
You think I'd care about
some senior member?

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:39.170
Go home right now

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.000
and raise the money.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:40.050
Do you understand?

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:41.400
[Hall of Loyalty]

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.190
-Go raise the money!
-Raise the money!

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.270
Let's go home.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.730
This is a tough problem.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.670
You've seen it yourself.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:57.000
This is no place for you.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:58.070
Let's go.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:59.650
How is my husband doing?

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.700
His condition

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.920
depends on the amount of money

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:02.780
you'll give us.

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.880
I have...

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.220
I have a hairpin

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:09.580
that's worth a million.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.230
I'll leave it here with you as collateral.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:13.110
Can you make sure

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:14.310
he gets proper meals?

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:15.230
Yu'er,

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:16.150
you can't give it away.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.630
That's...

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:18.490
A hairpin that's worth a million?

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.800
I've never seen one.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.800
Let me take a look.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.410
Boss Gui,

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:35.440
can you bring him out

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.740
so I can see him?

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:37.490
I...

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:39.000
need to ask him

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:40.360
where he hid the silver.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.320
Sounds good.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.840
This kidnapping is paying off well.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:45.920
Guys!

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.590
Bring that Gu fellow here.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:47.670
[Hall of Loyalty]

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:48.330
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:06.030
Pingyuan!

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:06.630
Mr. Chang.

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:07.580
Why are you here?

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.440
Where is Ms. Su?

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.910
Yu'er was worried about you,

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:11.170
so we came first.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.920
Father and I risked our lives

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:13.760
to come to your rescue,

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.800
yet you asked about her
the moment you saw us.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.110
No.

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:16.280
What can you do here?

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.110
You're not able

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:18.370
to solve this problem.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:19.590
Don't you see I'm worried about you?

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:20.850
Why can't I be here?

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.140
Enough. Stop arguing!

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.580
I can't believe you two

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:25.110
are quarreling at my place.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:25.880
Now, ask him

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:27.190
where he hid the silver.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:28.590
There's no silver at all.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:29.510
What?

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:32.040
No silver at all?

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:33.480
Then I guess

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:35.240
it's time to teach you a lesson.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:35.630
Guys!

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.880
[Hall of Loyalty]

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.800
Pierce his collarbones with an iron chain!

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.600
Please don't!

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:39.320
Let's talk it...

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.230
You're having his collarbones pierced?

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:41.840
Yes.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:44.280
I'll have it done right in front of you.

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:46.950
Let me tell you what's good

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.030
about this hairpin.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:48.450
Sure.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.410
Tell me about it.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:53.920
Look,

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:54.570
just...

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:57.840
Take her down!

00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:58.450
Back off!

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.020
Shut up and stay back,

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.440
or I'll have his right collarbone

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.230
pierced too!
