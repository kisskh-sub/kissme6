=Episode 2=
(Give everything back to me)

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.100
Protect her.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.140
Xie Yunyan.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.480
(Captain of the Garrison, Luo Yu)
Your death has come.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.740
Garrison Captain Luo arrived here
with your soldiers

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.060
in full force.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.140
For what purpose?

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.940
His Majesty has decreed,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.539
the Xiao father and son
colluded with the rebels,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.140
causing Linchuan to fall.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.940
All women of the Xiao household
are to be confined,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.660
and every male of the Xiao line
is to be seized and interrogated.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.140
Are you courting death?

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.460
(Why is everything different?)

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.180
(In my past life the Xiao family
fell three months later,)

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.300
(and Xie Yunyan was never captured.)

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.300
(Could it be because of me?)

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.059
My father and brothers
are out defending the nation,

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.340
fighting on the battlefield.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.539
How dare a treacherous cur like you

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.900
slander them behind their backs.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.180
You dare defy the imperial edict?

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.219
It seems the Xiao family
not only committed treason

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.260
but even harbors thoughts of rebellion.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.220
The matter of the Xiao family
is not yet settled.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.640
If you kill him
in defiance of the decree,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.740
you will cement
the Xiao family's guilt of treason.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.820
There will be no path left
for redemption.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.339
Am I to stand by and watch him
slander the Xiao family?

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.539
Did you not hear?

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.659
The garrison came to seize him

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.220
by His Majesty's command.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.980
What matters most now is staying alive.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.100
The women of the Xiao family
are still in the capital.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.460
Only by protecting yourself

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.180
can you protect them.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.980
And clear your father
and brother's names.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.180
Seize them all.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.700
Let them go.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.580
This woman is my elder brother's wife,
who fled the marriage.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.620
The divorce letter is here.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.100
Luo Yu.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.980
Do not force my hand.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.540
You know the consequences.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.660
Su Jinyuan.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.820
My elder brother waited for you
and shielded you all this time.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.780
This is the last thing
he can do for you.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.660
Take it.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.900
Leave the Xiao family.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.060
From this moment on,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.260
you have nothing to do
with the Xiao family.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.500
Take them away.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.500
Young Lady Su.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.380
Let's go.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.420
Young lady.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.740
The young master had intended

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.500
to bring you back to the manor.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.740
But with the Xiao family like this now...

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.260
Please take care of yourself.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.580
I must ride to Linchuan
and report at once.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.820
(Yuan. Your father once did a great kindness
to the Xiao family.)

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.700
(Our marriage)

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.660
(was formed because of that bond.)

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.340
(I know that since your parents passed,
you have lived under another's roof,)

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.900
(enduring much hardship.)

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.659
(And with me campaigning far
from home year after year,)

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.280
(you have waited in vain for so long.)

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.100
(I, too, carry guilt in my heart.)

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.820
(Now that I can finally marry you,)

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.500
(I thought that
once you entered the Xiao family,)

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.700
(our household
could shelter you from now on.)

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.780
(But I forgot to ask you one thing.)

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.140
(Are you willing to marry me?)

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.820
(If you should look back someday,)

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.220
(when I return victorious,)

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.240
(I will welcome you with
a bridal procession that fills the road,)

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.520
(and bring you home with honor.)

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.340
(If you meet someone worthy,)

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.980
(bring him to see me.)

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.420
(In the name of your elder brother,)

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.900
(I will send you off at your wedding.)

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.780
(Take it.)

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.780
(Leave the Xiao family.)

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.940
(From this moment on,)

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.940
(you have nothing to do
with the Xiao family.)

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.900
(If in my past life,)

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.780
(I had known the Xiao family
would treat me so,)

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:08.820
(I would have...)

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.700
(Horse.)

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.020
(Do you want
to save the Xiao family too?)

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.700
(Xiao Manor)

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.940
Liu Zhu, hurry.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.460
Stop.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.520
The old mistress's illness has returned.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.080
The seventh young lady
has caught a chill as well.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.979
Please, let us out

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.880
to buy some medicine.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.299
- We will only...
- No one is allowed out.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.700
Letting them die
without aid is against all reason.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.060
Liu Zhu.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.579
Liu Zhu.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.700
If you do not get back inside now,
you will be killed on sight.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.499
(The Xiao family is in crisis.)

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.260
(Silver is needed
to smooth matters everywhere.)

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.460
(My father
left behind considerable wealth.)

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.940
(I will ask my uncle and aunt for it.)

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.380
(They will surely help.)

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.739
(Su Manor)

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.739
Young lady,

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.500
why have you returned?

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.980
(Yu. Su Xinyue)

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.740
Burn away all the bad luck.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.499
The Xiao family refused to let me
marry in as her replacement.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.220
Now this is their retribution.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.420
That coward Su Jinyuan,

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.579
she has probably already
been sold off by that rake Lu Zhuo,

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.740
and is still counting money for him.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.900
Mother, you truly think of everything.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.420
Bribing Lu Zhuo to help us.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.960
(Spirit Tablet of Beloved Father Su Wansheng)
That cursed orphan

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.460
(and Beloved Mother Cheng Wanru)
Su Jinyuan.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.660
After all these years
living off us and taking what's ours,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.620
she even dares to steal your man.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.300
She should have
been thrown out long ago.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.099
My precious daughter,

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.139
all these fine things of Su Jinyuan's

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.620
now belong to us.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.100
Su Jinyuan?

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.860
So Lu Zhuo

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.140
was someone my aunt
brought in to harm me.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.100
Su Jinyuan.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.540
Why have you come back?

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.380
This jade pendant...

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.860
My younger brother never parted with it.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.819
How did you get it?

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.420
You...

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.699
So what if I took it?

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.219
Your brother has been missing for years.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.100
Who knows where he died.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.780
Give it back.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.180
Give it back.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.220
(Spirit Tablet of Beloved Father Su Wansheng
and Beloved Mother Cheng Wanru)

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.100
(Spirit Tablet of Beloved Father Su Wansheng
and Beloved Mother Cheng Wanru)

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.779
What are you doing?

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.979
Where is my brother?

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.699
Did you kill him too?

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.499
We did not kill him.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.220
We only sold him.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.060
Sold him?

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.899
He was only four years old!

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.300
How is that any different
from killing him yourselves?

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:36.899
Yue!

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.219
Yue!

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.019
Mother, save me!

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.659
Master, come quickly!

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.380
She is going to kill her!

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.259
(Su Wanquan)
Su Jinyuan, are you mad?

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.700
Pull her away, quickly!

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.939
Su Jinyuan,

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.339
we raised you.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.019
You cannot be ungrateful!

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:53.939
Exactly.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.620
Ungrateful?

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.220
All these years,

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.180
no matter how harshly you treated me,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.620
I still regarded you
as my parents reborn.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.139
But you?

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.020
What have you ever done?

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.540
You seized my parents' estate.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.700
You tried to steal my marriage.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.299
You conspired with Lu Zhuo
to deceive and humiliate me.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.380
And you even sold my younger brother.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.820
The sad thing is

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.020
that when I first entered this house,

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.020
I actually believed you
would stand by me.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.660
Now

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.140
that I've seen your true faces,

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.420
I owe this family nothing anymore.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.499
Su Jinyuan!

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.579
- Don't move!
- You...

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.740
What are you trying to do?

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.380
I am taking back what is mine.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.980
My parents' estate,

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.059
convert it into banknotes
and hand it to me.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:51.660
You...

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.260
You are dreaming.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.179
Help me!

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.780
- Su Jinyuan, how dare you!
- Uncle.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.980
My patience is running thin.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.580
Do you want the money

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.779
or her life?

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:04.259
Master!

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.059
Stop!

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.539
Enough!

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.540
I will give it to you!

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.660
Wait here.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.140
Yue.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.699
Money.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.659
Here is the money.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.219
You

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.580
let Xinyue go.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.900
Quick, release her.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.500
These fifty thousand taels

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.859
will sever all ties

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.580
between me and the Su family.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.740
From this day on,

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.300
all ties between me and the Su family

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.740
are severed.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.140
Are you alright, Yue?

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.899
You frightened me to death.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.540
You frightened me to death.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.819
(Father and Mother,)

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.940
(Luo,)

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.940
(one day,)

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.060
(what they owed us,)

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.900
(I will take all of it back.)

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:06.860
