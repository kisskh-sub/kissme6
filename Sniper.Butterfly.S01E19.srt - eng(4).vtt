That's not it.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.266
You can head to the living room

Hurry and leave.
Turn off the lights and close the door.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.490

Now, she's injured.

00:15:53.066 --> 00:15:54.490

00:16:03.022 --> 00:16:04.800
It's not like I can't
take care of myself.

00:16:04.822 --> 00:16:06.977
It's too troublesome for me
to travel back and forth.

And, Chun Chang
visits me from time to time.

Besides, your back
isn't in good shape either.

I can't afford to let it worsen
because of my situation.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:16.970
Alright, then.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.600
But, let's make this clear.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.610
Call me immediately

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.700
if there's anything.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.340
I will, Dad.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.010
Wu,

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.460
how was school?

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.550
Have you familiarized yourself
with the new courses?

00:16:35.555 --> 00:16:36.244
I have.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.360
I am currently exploring

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.844
the field of artificial intelligence.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.650
Although I haven't explored it before,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.490
this time, I have the chance

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.300
to learn and apply
what I've learned in school.

00:16:47.511 --> 00:16:48.711
I'm quite happy about it.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.240
You see, you've always been clear

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.800
with what you're trying to achieve.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.650
That's great.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.540
But I heard from your sister

00:16:57.155 --> 00:16:58.488
that you're planning to apply for

00:16:58.533 --> 00:16:59.940
direct admission
to the PHD next.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.580
Won't that be too stressful for you?

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:03.820
Not at all.

00:17:04.822 --> 00:17:06.690
Since I've made my decision,
I have to face it.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:09.450
Besides,

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.980
I never wanted to let go

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:13.340
of the things I like.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.170
That's why I work extra hard.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.610
Indeed.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.540
Where there's a will,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.170
there's a way.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.890
Wu, I expect great things from you.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:28.650
Thank you, Mr. Cen.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.170
Eat up.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.000
Eat up, okay?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.450
Eat up.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.820
You should eat up as well.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.300
You too.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.130
Help him out.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.740
Mr. Cen, let me do it.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.100
Let me do it.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.070
I'll do it.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.580
Okay.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.030
I'll leave it to you, then.

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.020
I'll head back first.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:11.650
Okay.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.690
Jin,

00:18:19.088 --> 00:18:21.110
remember to replenish
your nutrients, rest well,

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.266
and do some light exercises.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.600
This way, you'll recover quickly.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.480
Got it.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.720
I'll head back first, then.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.170
Okay.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.830
Wu,

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.100
I'll leave her to you, then.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.210
Call me if you need anything.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.890
Okay.

00:18:32.355 --> 00:18:33.210
I'll be leaving now.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:42.270
Mr. Cen, please drive safely.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:42.890
Okay.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.170
What's wrong?

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.110
Next time, can you
please be more mindful

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.200
when my father's here?

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.060
Be mindful of what?

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:57.000
Of course, it's...

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.110
Your leg is injured.
It's inconvenient to use a crutch.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.888
Isn't it common sense
for me to carry you here?

00:19:03.311 --> 00:19:04.622
I'll go and do the dishes.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:38.540
Are my crow's feet

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.850
that obvious?

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.500
How did you fall?

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:19.610
Here.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.610
Be careful.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.780
What happened?

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.590
The eye cream lid fell behind the door.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.540
I wanted to pick it up.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:31.880
You should've just called for me.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.270
You...

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.200
What if you fall again?

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.733
It'll worsen the situation, you know?

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.639
It's a minor deal.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.280
I'll be useless
if I have to call for you

00:20:37.288 --> 00:20:38.311
just to help me with that.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:56.540
So,

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.850
were you actually using it?

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.610
Of course not.

00:21:02.688 --> 00:21:04.610
You've been working tirelessly
day and night.

00:21:04.666 --> 00:21:07.080
You bought something this expensive.
It's not worth it at all.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.060
I'm going to keep it

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.755
and use it as a bad present example.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:16.130
That's fine.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.210
What are you saying?

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.820
Jin!

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.580
Come back!

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.020
Come here! Close the door!

00:21:27.333 --> 00:21:28.480
I left something behind.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.866
Come here! Don't let him see you!

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:31.650
Turn on the tap!

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:32.500
Jin?

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.170
Hurry and duck!

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.370
Dad, I'm taking a shower.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.070
I didn't see Wu around.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.100
Where did he go?

00:21:48.377 --> 00:21:49.640
He went to the convenience store

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.888
to buy some stuff on my behalf.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.610
Did you forget your keys?

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.310
Your mother has been criticizing me

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:56.555
for being forgetful as well.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.020
I was almost home just now.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.377
But there were no keys in my pocket
when I checked it.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.640
I assume

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.650
that I've left them here.

00:22:02.933 --> 00:22:04.170
Mom actually criticized you?

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:05.590
She's very forgetful

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:06.780
as well.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.850
You cheeky girl.

00:22:19.066 --> 00:22:20.740
Do you want my father to see you?

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:51.170
No.

00:22:53.644 --> 00:22:54.890
I know what you're trying to do.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.780
Jin.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.580
I found my keys.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.690
So,

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.480
do you need me to keep you company?

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.890
I can leave once Wu is back.

00:23:15.066 --> 00:23:16.822
I don't want anything to happen to you.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.650
No need for that.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.310
I think he'll return very soon.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:20.540
You should head back and rest.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.880
Alright, then.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.640
If so, I'll head back now.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.440
Be careful, okay?

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.780
Call me if you need anything.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:28.740
Safe trip.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.060
You should go out now.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.340
Come.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.300
Be careful.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.600
This is a sumptuous breakfast.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:43.911
I have school to attend
to for the next few days.

00:24:43.911 --> 00:24:44.980
That's why I made extra.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.260
I've already portioned them.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.580
You can have it for lunch
after you heat it up.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.219
Leave the plates there
once you're done.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.511
I'll do the dishes when I'm back.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:00.720
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.688
It's not like
I'm entirely useless, you know?

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:05.740
Here.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:07.540
Thank you.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.060
It's been over a month.

00:25:14.066 --> 00:25:15.690
Your condition is
finally getting better.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:23.690
By the way,

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.980
I remembered something.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:28.820
Weren't you pretty feisty the other day?

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.690
You told me

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.690
that it wouldn't be easy for me

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.610
to call for you again.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.650
But Chun Chang called me.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.110
So, you won't come

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.133
if I tell you to come?

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.820
How dare you do that?

00:25:59.555 --> 00:26:00.270
Look at the time.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.555
Don't you have a class to attend?

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.100
Just leave already.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.930
Goodbye.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:19.850
Goodbye.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.279
You can register your name yourself.
Why did you drag me with you?

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.830
I need to head home
and look after Sister.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:12.210
I thought Cen Jin
had almost recovered fully.

00:28:12.688 --> 00:28:13.750
This is a rare chance for us

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:15.622
to close our distance
with the course beau.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.440
Come on,

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.690
join me.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.930
I'm begging you here.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.980
I won't take up too much of your time.

00:28:25.177 --> 00:28:27.100
I can leave
after the registration, right?

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:29.690
You're so kind.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.210
To be honest,

00:28:46.777 --> 00:28:48.240
your house has become much tidier

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.170
ever since Wu's arrival.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.410
Sister, I'm back.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:58.260
Wu, you're back.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.750
Hi, Chun Chang.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:00.580
Hi.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.300
It seems you took
great care of your sister.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.350
Don't worry.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.000
I'm not here to steal your job from you.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.222
I'm just here to visit her.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:08.590
Alright.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:09.130
If so,

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.780
I'll go and cook first.

00:29:10.866 --> 00:29:11.740
You guys can go ahead.

00:29:11.844 --> 00:29:13.180
Just call me if you need anything.

00:29:17.244 --> 00:29:19.311
You guys are together
day in and day out.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:20.980
Don't you think he's cute?

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.890
To be honest,

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:31.590
don't you think

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.222
that I'm going a little overboard here?

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.060
I don't want to accept his feelings,

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.410
yet I'm enjoying all the care
he provides.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.340
If you enjoy it,

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.580
you should get together with him.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.130
That won't do.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:50.500
Why not?

00:29:51.666 --> 00:29:53.930
Falling in love isn't
something you do with your brain.

00:29:53.955 --> 00:29:55.533
It's something you do with your heart.

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:57.410
Don't tell me

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.580
you don't have
any feelings for him at all.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.340
Actually, I feel quite conflicted.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:12.550
I don't know

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:13.540
how I feel either.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.890
I just know

00:30:15.977 --> 00:30:18.000
that I don't want
to fall out with Li Wu.

00:30:18.355 --> 00:30:20.155
I don't want us to become strangers.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:27.060
I think you care more about him

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.130
than you think.

00:30:46.622 --> 00:30:47.690
(Are you going to sleep?)

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:52.820
(Not yet.)

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.500
(Do you need anything?)

00:30:54.511 --> 00:30:55.955
(I'll head to your room immediately.)

00:30:58.266 --> 00:30:59.555
(You don't need to come.)

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:07.060
(Do you still like me?)

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.070
(Yeah, I do.)

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.380
(Wu)

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.580
Next, you have
to listen to me carefully.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.820
Don't get so worked up like last time.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.500
You...

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.540
Are you going to forbid me

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.170
from liking you again?

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.100
That's not it.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.830
Just now, I was considering

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:54.930
the relationship between us.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.070
For the time being,

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.377
I still cannot accept something

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.066
beyond a brother-sister relationship.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:08.890
Li Wu,

00:32:09.822 --> 00:32:11.130
I'm honored that a guy like you,

00:32:11.133 --> 00:32:12.930
who's great both inside and outside,

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.890
likes me.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.610
And, you really know
how to stroke my ego.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.750
However, if we were

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:20.780
to be together for real,

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:21.880
we'd have

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.260
to face many issues.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.300
For example,

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.160
you're still studying

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.244
while I'm already working.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.370
The environments
we live in are different.

00:32:30.755 --> 00:32:32.888
The people we spend time with
are different as well.

00:32:34.266 --> 00:32:36.511
And, there's also
a huge age gap between us.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:37.640
It may create

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.066
a significant generation gap.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.170
Up next,

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.110
we have to come up with a way

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:45.740
to explain it to my parents.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:54.740
Some of my friends

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.590
do have

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.260
boyfriends who are younger than them.

00:32:58.088 --> 00:33:00.400
They come together when it fits,
and part when it doesn't.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.850
It's delightful and stress-free.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:04.650
However,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.210
what if it were us?

00:33:06.422 --> 00:33:07.911
Can you actually accept that?

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:13.450
You're a prideful boy.

00:33:14.133 --> 00:33:16.244
I don't think
you'll be willing to accept that.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.270
I know

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.690
that I'm being realistic here.

00:33:28.555 --> 00:33:30.020
However, I think we should face this

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.580
with a logical mind.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:33.580
Keeping things unspoken

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.370
will do neither of us any good,

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.890
especially you.

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:39.377
It's downright irresponsible.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:41.930
I...

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:43.890
You know this too.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.550
My previous marriage

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:47.690
was a failure.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:50.480
I'm not ready

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.020
to accept a new relationship yet.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:55.100
Our feelings

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.580
change.

00:33:57.155 --> 00:33:59.400
They'll become much more complicated
than you think.

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.980
I don't care.

00:34:04.933 --> 00:34:06.511
I'm confident that I can overcome them.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.170
We don't get to make the call here.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.500
You'll graduate in a few more years.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:18.280
A wider world awaits

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.290
your exploration.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.100
You'll get to know

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.730
all kinds of outstanding people.

00:34:23.066 --> 00:34:24.210
And, you'll also get to know

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.060
all kinds of outstanding ladies.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.940
Perhaps then you'll realize

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.210
I'm nothing special either.

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:33.920
I don't want to become the cage

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.540
that confines you.

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.980
Li Wu,

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:40.500
you should explore the world first.

00:34:40.777 --> 00:34:42.480
Go and explore the world
that's filled with

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.460
richer and more wonderful things.

00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:45.800
You can decide after that.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.580
Sister.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.500
No one's going to be better than you.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:07.320
Let's not

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.580
jump to conclusions yet.

00:35:09.022 --> 00:35:10.540
We should give each other some time.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.810
If, by this time next year,

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.460
you still fancy me,

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.770
and I don't fancy anyone else,

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.000
we can talk about it.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.650
Okay?

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:30.210
Really?

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.730
Yeah.

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:35.880
Thanks for your care

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.100
all this time.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.630
In a few days,

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:39.900
I'll have my cast removed.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.150
You should pack up

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:42.060
and return to school.

00:35:42.155 --> 00:35:44.488
You shouldn't travel back and forth.
It'll affect your studies.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.730
If so,

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:48.840
I'll head back

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.022
once your cast is removed.

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:51.380
So,

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:52.060
good night.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:57.170
Well...

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.650
I...

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:02.690
Can I still like you?

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:06.980
Suit yourself.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.610
I'll keep liking you.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.460
That's your business.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.500
Good night.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:22.650
Good night.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:37.020
(I'll keep liking you until I die.)

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.610
(And, I'll only like you alone.)

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:51.100
(Good job.)

00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:59.210
(From today onward,)

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.130
(can you stop treating me)

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:02.810
(only as your younger brother?)

00:37:11.577 --> 00:37:13.060
(What else should I treat you as?)

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.540
(A man.)

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.440
(Sleep early,)

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.290
