00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.680
(Episode 118)

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.530
Stop it!

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.280
Let go!

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.770
Who are you people?
Why are you doing this to me?

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.400
Can't you tell?

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.940
You got kidnapped because of your dad.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.340
My dad?

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.080
Because Chairman Min Doo Sik
treats his promises like dirt.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.250
How do you know my dad
is Chairman Min Doo Sik?

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.220
So you kidnapped me on purpose?

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.690
Did you think we just picked you up
off the street?

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.390
It's always the kids
who pay for their parents' mistakes.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.800
So are you going to kill me?

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.130
We'll see.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.530
It all depends on what your dad does.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.720
Did you get some sleep?

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.660
The medicine helped.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.060
I slept right through the night.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.460
See? That's why you need
to take better care of yourself.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.900
I'm so worried something
will happen to you.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.570
The situation is so hopeless,

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.330
so I don't even have the energy
to take care of myself.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.440
So, you're in danger because the chairman
signed his stake over to that woman?

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.480
I'd be lucky
if I were the only one in danger.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.280
If this goes south,
the entire company could go under.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.710
So what do we do now?

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.280
I have to find a way.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.750
I have to get through this crisis somehow.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.520
Okay. Please get some more rest.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.130
Se Ri called me?

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.540
You have one new voice message.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.470
Kyung Chae. It's Se Ri.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.610
I'm going to be a bit late tonight.
I'm covering a shift for a coworker.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.180
Would you be able to
come pick me up later?

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.610
I'll be waiting in front of the cafe
in about three hours.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.390
What's with her?

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.700
Don't tell me...

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.500
she never came home last night.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.280
The phone is turned off.
Connecting to voicemail.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.340
After the beep...

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.520
Have you seen Se Ri by any chance?

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.220
Se Ri? No.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.690
How about you, Ja Kyung?

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.530
Manager Gong.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.770
- The breakfast isn't...
- Where's Se Ri?

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.000
- Isn't she sleeping in her room?
- No, she's not in there.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.970
Maybe she's in the bathroom?

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.740
I was just in there.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.410
Then where on earth is she?

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.910
Did anyone see Se Ri come home last night?

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.080
Why? Did Se Ri not come home last night?

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.490
She was quiet for a while,
but here she goes again.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.690
She's probably living it up
at some five-star hotel.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.730
Seriously, that brat is so immature.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.130
Has she no idea what's going on
with this family right now?

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.170
I know, right?
The Min family is about to go under.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.800
Hey, forget about her.
Is she really our biggest problem now?

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.840
Lucia has declared war on us.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.810
You literally had a hair-pulling fight
with her yesterday.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.780
- You still don't get it after all that?
- Ji Seop is right about that.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.810
She'll probably show her true colors
and come at us with everything she's got.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.580
So has that woman
really taken everything away as he said?

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.960
Why else would we all be so serious
this morning?

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.920
What kind of a woman does that?

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.530
Your father has terrible judgment
when it comes to women.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.660
Go to the company and discuss this
with Lawyer Kim first.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.800
See if it's legally possible
to get the stake back.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.170
We have to get it back, whatever it takes.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.940
Let's have a solid breakfast first,

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.610
and then we can figure out
what to do about her.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.880
- Eat up.
- Okay.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.350
So, regarding the chairman's stake
that's already been gifted away,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.850
you want to know if there's a legal way
to get it back, right?

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.750
I don't care what it costs.
File a lawsuit if you have to.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.290
Just take it to court.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.330
First, just look into
whether it's legally possible or not.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.490
I'm not sure.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.360
If the chairman gifted it voluntarily
and even signed the papers himself,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.970
then a lawsuit to get it back
is practically impossible.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.440
So what are you saying?
That woman is really...

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.100
the largest shareholder of Mingang now?

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.310
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.340
Is there really no way?

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.750
- Unfortunately, not at the moment.
- Hey! Forget it! Let's go somewhere else.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.850
Somewhere else? Where?

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.020
Do you think hiring the best lawyer
in the country will change everything?

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.790
Who's to say it won't? And you.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.720
You were fired as a prosecutor
for corruption, weren't you?

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.860
You're not qualified!

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.060
Did you really just say that?

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.930
Come on, what are you waiting for?
I said, let's go get a second opinion.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.170
I'd rather die than let that woman
take it from us.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.770
Even if it costs tens, no,
hundreds of millions in legal fees,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.310
I'm going to get our father's stake back.
Just you watch!

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.870
Darn.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.040
(Mingang Distribution)

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.670
So, are you happy now
that you've stolen our father's stake?

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.500
You've got Mingang Distribution.
You must feel on top of the world.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.110
Was this why you got close to our dad?
Was it all just an act?

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.440
Hey, you don't need to be so polite
given the current circumstances.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.350
Listen, you picked the wrong family
to mess with.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.980
You should've picked someone
in your own weight class.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.850
You think we don't have money
or connections?

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.690
You really think people of our status
can't handle a woman like you?

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.390
Just you wait.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.100
Soon, you'll get what's coming to you,
and then some.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.870
How could you even think
of conning our family?

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.200
"Conning?"

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.440
- Watch your mouth!
- If it isn't a con, then what is it?

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.180
Everything you're doing is a con!
And you have the nerve to pull it on us?

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.780
- Do you know what kind of family this is?
- And what kind would that be?

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.550
A dysfunctional family
that's itching to tear each other apart?

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.080
Crushing your older sister,

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.390
sacrificing your younger sister
to kick out your brother.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.690
A broken family,
scrambling to satisfy their own greed.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.930
Look at the way this woman is talking.
How dare you call us a messed-up family?

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.160
I guarantee you,
you will live to regret this.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.330
If there's one thing we can't stand,
it's having something taken from us.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.170
We won't even have to lift a finger.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.470
Kyung Chae is already out for blood.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.540
You're going to walk out of here
with nothing.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.510
You'll lose the entire stake...

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.840
and be on your knees,
begging us to spare you.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.280
After all, money is all we have.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.380
There's nothing money can't do!

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.490
You people are truly hopeless, aren't you?

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.960
Even at a time like this,
all you care about is money!

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.260
Do you really think money is
the answer to everything?

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.600
When it really matters, that money
you worship like the Almighty...

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.500
will end up betraying you.
Then you'll learn money isn't everything.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.440
Just dwelling on it won't solve anything.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.910
For now, the important thing is
not to play into their hands.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.550
Forget about that.
I need you to find Se Ri.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.750
She stayed out all night last night
without a word.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.120
She said she was working late...

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.890
and asked me to meet
at the cafe she works at,

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:35.990
but I couldn't make it.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.020
So I don't know if she's just sulking
to get back at me.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.060
- Se Ri did that?
- The family thinks she's just in a hotel,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.430
but you never know. Please find her.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.270
What is it?

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.170
Do you think you can't do me this favor,
given our history?

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.240
Because we're over?

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.280
No, that's not it.
Of course I'll look into it.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.080
It won't take long
if I put my sources on it.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.610
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.580
(Mingang Distribution)

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.430
The phone is turned off.
Connecting to voicemail.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.830
You will be charged after the tone.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.450
Did she not come in?

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.100
Hi. Did Se Ri not come in today?

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.330
She's a no-call, no-show.
I thought she was taking this seriously.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.000
And you have no idea
what might have happened?

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.840
Her phone's off,
so I came all the way here.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.570
I have no idea what could've happened.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.850
Kids these days just have no sense
of responsibility.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.820
You're really not going to eat?

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.260
Figures.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.890
I suppose
the chairman's precious baby girl...

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.730
is probably too good
for food like this, right?

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.300
When are you going to let me go home?

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.970
You know this is only going to
end badly for you guys, right?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.270
Do you really think my dad
will let you get away with this?

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.570
As a matter of fact,
I was just about to ask your dad...

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.010
what to do with you.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.420
Hello, Chairman. It's me.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.590
How dare you call me?

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.930
I thought I'd never have to deal
with you again.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.660
Even if we're done here,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.700
you still need to settle up.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.500
You still haven't paid me
for the Moon Tae Kyung job.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.300
You call yourselves fixers,
but you can't even do the job right.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.440
And you have the nerve to ask for payment?
You shameless jerks.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.240
If you ever call me
about such nonsense again,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.740
you're dead. Got it?

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.810
Dad!

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.020
Se Ri. What are you doing there?

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.190
Dad, they dragged me here.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.020
I want to go home.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.660
Do something about these guys!

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.060
You heard her, Chairman.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.130
So what's it going to be?

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.900
Do you want us to send her back?

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.670
Or should we just end her right here?

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:14.570
You jerks.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.340
How much do you want?

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.010
How much do you want to let her go?

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.110
You jerks. What makes you think
I'd trust you and pay you first?

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.280
I need to see that she's safe
with my own eyes.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.590
Hello?

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.390
The phone is turned off.
Connecting to voicemail.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.030
Manager Gong.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.660
Manager Gong!

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.060
What's going on?

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.970
The chairman wanted me to
call you, Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.030
Gosh.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.170
Come home this instant.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.210
What do you mean by why?

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.340
It's because Se Ri
just got herself kidnapped.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.540
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.710
Kidnapped?

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.480
What do you mean?

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.780
Any luck? Did you check the hotel?

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.120
She's not there?

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.950
You mean Min Se Ri
isn't on the guest list?

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.890
I was just about to tell you.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.660
She's not at the hotel.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.660
Se Ri's been kidnapped.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.130
Apparently, the kidnappers
called my father.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.500
What do we do?

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.000
Kidnapped?

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.440
What are we going to do?

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.660
What's wrong with her now?

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.060
She said Se Ri's been kidnapped.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.590
Apparently, Chairman Min
got a ransom call.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.000
What?

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.600
What did you say happened to my Se Ri?

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.770
Then why are you just standing there?

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.770
Aren't you going to go find her?

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.210
What are you going to do
if something happens to her?

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.010
You're her father!

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.850
Aren't you going to find her?

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.790
- Go find Se Ri! Find her right now!
- And why should I?

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:12.220
You want me to suddenly drum up
some fatherly affection I don't have?

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.560
No. I'm going to live my life my own way
until the end.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.530
I'm going to live on my own terms
right to the end.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.430
You're not even human.
How can you say that at a time like this?

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.240
I'll never forgive you.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.180
Unbelievable.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.720
What do you mean Se Ri's been kidnapped?

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.550
Who on earth would do this to Se Ri?

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.490
It's the same guys from before.
The ones who took Moon Tae Kyung.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.890
I refused to pay them
since they let Moon Tae Kyung get away.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.160
And now they've taken Se Ri
to get back at me.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.660
So you're saying this is all your fault.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.030
Why would you do that?
You should've just paid them!

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.070
What good could possibly come from
getting on the bad side...

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.370
of people who have nothing to lose?

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.140
Do you think they'd think twice
about anything?

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.440
They're capable of anything!

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.280
If Se Ri gets hurt because of this,
will you take responsibility, Father?

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.510
How dare you?
You think I'm not worried sick?

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.720
You think you're the only one
who cares about Se Ri?

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.420
Do I mean nothing to her?

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.050
Even so, can you possibly feel
what I'm feeling?

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.420
I'm her mother! You can't be more worried!

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.660
See? I knew what I heard was right.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.500
What? So she's decided
to spill the beans about Se Ri's birth?

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.540
If they so much as touch
a hair on Se Ri's head,

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.000
I'm never seeing you again.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.050
Mom!

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:44.920
What is it now?

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.250
Why did you come running in here
out of breath and practically tooting?

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.950
Don't tell me something happened
at the house again.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.590
Don't even get me started.
Do you know what I just heard?

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.690
At this point, nothing I hear
about your in-laws surprises me anymore.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.400
It'd have to be your older sister-in-law
having a daughter,

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.100
and that daughter turning out
to be your youngest sister-in-law.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.500
Exactly.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.400
Can you believe it?
Se Ri is actually Kyung Chae's daughter.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.770
What? Are you serious?

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:09.870
Wait, how can two sisters
be mother and daughter?

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.340
Kyung Chae secretly had a daughter,
and Father registered her as his own.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.850
I had a hunch all along.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.480
I'm telling you, I heard it myself
outside Kyung Chae's room.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.550
But my husband made such a fuss
and insisted it wasn't true.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.290
Yang Mal Sook! Oh Ja Kyung!

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.220
I think I'm becoming a psychic!

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.990
My body is shaking,
and my voice is strange.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:30.160
Is there a kitchen knife?

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.730
Bring it to me.
I want to dance on the blade!

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.970
All who seek to know the future,
come to me!

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:39.440
But why suddenly reveal a secret
they've kept hidden for so long?

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.670
Well, I guess...

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.710
Oh, right. Se Ri has been kidnapped.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.940
What?

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.710
Your youngest sister-in-law
has been kidnapped?

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.890
What's wrong? Why are you crying?
What happened?

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.330
Tae Kyung, what am I going to do?
My Se Ri...

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.860
Se Ri's been kidnapped.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.300
What are you talking about? Who took her?

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:09.600
I don't know.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.240
Apparently, Chairman Min
just got a ransom call.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.840
I saw Min Kyung Chae run out after a call,
so it must be serious.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.980
What do I do?
What's going to happen to my Se Ri?

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.050
She acts tough,
but she's actually really sensitive,

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.220
and she gets scared easily.

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.850
Please help find my Se Ri.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.460
Tae Kyung, please find my Se Ri.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.860
All right. Just try to calm down first.
First, we...

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.330
Do you think it's the same guys?
The ones who kidnapped me?

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:46.400
They must have been promised a huge sum
to get rid of me without a trace.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.370
Knowing Chairman Min,

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.410
there's no way
he would've paid them after they failed.

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:54.340
So they're trying to get a ransom
for Se Ri instead?

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:57.780
And on top of that, they probably hold
a grudge against Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:03.250
Then what's going to happen to Se Ri?

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.490
This means she's in real danger.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.830
Let's start by looking for her together.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.590
I have a rough idea of where they operate.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.130
Se Ri will be okay, won't she?

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.200
I can't bear to lose my daughter
a second time.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.870
If something happens to Se Ri,
I won't be able to go on.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.840
Right. We have to make sure
nothing happens to her.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.380
We'll be the ones to find her
before anything can happen to her,

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:29.880
so try not to worry too much.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.560
We'd be better off calling the police
and making this a public investigation.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.760
Rather than just sitting here
waiting at their mercy.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.930
You said it yourself.
They're guys with nothing to lose.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.200
What would guys like that be afraid of?

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.600
If the investigation goes public,
they'll kill the hostage and flee by boat.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.170
Then what are we supposed to do?

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.840
Just sit on our hands
and wait for them to call?

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.370
Then we might as well
get the ransom money ready.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.640
That way, when they call,
we can trade it for Se Ri right away.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.480
What makes you think they'll return her
just because they get the ransom?

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:06.850
Have you forgotten who we're dealing with?

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.190
If they return the hostage,
they'd leave a witness to their crime.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.120
Do you really think
they'd be that foolish?

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:13.660
So, you're saying...

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.390
Se Ri isn't going to
come back to us alive?

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.260
We should be finding a way to save her.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.900
Don't say awful things like that!

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.240
This is just someone else's issue
to you, isn't it?

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.070
Then again,

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.510
I suppose it's natural for you
to be this detached.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.910
It would be different
if you were her father.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.750
Even if I were her father,
nothing would change.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:39.520
I live life on my own terms.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.490
Fine. In that case,
I'll just wash my hands of this,

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.590
and I'll be on my way.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.320
Go ahead.
Let's see how you handle this on your own.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.760
What am I supposed to do on my own
in this situation?

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:53.830
Please help me.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:55.900
Please find my Se Ri.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.740
I can't go on
if something happens to my Se Ri.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.740
What mother could lose her child
and stay sane?

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.720
So you want me to look for Se Ri with you?

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.350
Please help me, Madam Jang.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.420
Please think of my Se Ri
as your own granddaughter...

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.350
and help me find her.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.590
As my own granddaughter?

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.290
I'm not sure if I can do that
just like that.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.430
But I'll help you look for her.
Whether she's my granddaughter or not,

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.940
a young girl has been kidnapped.
I wouldn't be human if I just ignored it.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.110
Madam Jang...

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:39.840
If I retrace the route
those men dragged me along,

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.650
I think it might lead to something.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.650
Then it'll be faster to split up
than to search together.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.090
I suppose so.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.420
Then tell me every location
you can remember.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.960
I'll call Tae Joo to help out too.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.060
It's Kim Sun Jae.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.000
- What is it?
- I need to ask you something.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.340
You're with Moon Tae Kyung right now,
aren't you?

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.410
Is that why you called?

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.840
That's not the real reason.
Is he there with you or not?

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.810
What if he is?
With everything that's going on...

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.520
I think the guys
who kidnapped Min Se Ri...

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.290
are the same ones
who kidnapped Moon Tae Kyung.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.560
They failed the contract killing
Chairman Min Doo Sik requested,

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.860
and Moon Tae Kyung probably
just got lucky and escaped.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.000
But Chairman Min isn't the type of man
to pay for a failed job.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.570
So they must have a grudge
against Chairman Min Doo Sik,

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:39.170
which gives them every reason
to kidnap his precious youngest daughter.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.310
- So what's your point?
- If he's there, put him on.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:43.870
I'll talk to him myself.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.780
We need to find Se Ri first, don't we?

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.210
He wants to talk to you.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.620
This is Moon Tae Kyung.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:00.920
I was thinking the same thing.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.500
I'll text you the locations I remember.
You handle your side,

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.200
and we'll search elsewhere.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:11.230
Whoever finds Se Ri first
contacts the other.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.640
What did he say?

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.840
He's thinking the same thing we are.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.780
That Se Ri's kidnappers are the same guys
from before.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.150
And that they must've taken her
the same route they took me.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.860
He asked for the locations I remember
so he can help with the search.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.660
That man really is exceptionally smart.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.430
How did he figure all that out on his own?

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.600
His reasoning is insane.
He's right about every single thing.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.330
So we should tell him, then?

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:46.740
We have to.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.140
Right now,
we need all the help we can get.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:03.250
These are the addresses I saw on their GPS
when they were driving me around.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:06.060
They're mostly abandoned warehouses
or stalled construction sites.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.960
We'll check the warehouses.
You check the other spots.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.300
What's the update?

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.270
You just told me to wait.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.310
So how much longer am I supposed to wait?

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.310
- You said you'd find out where Se Ri is.
- I did.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.780
It's better if we split up
to cover more ground...

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.280
and check in with each other periodically.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:33.280
I'll text you the GPS addresses.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.420
Kim Sun Jae will report to Min Kyung Chae,
and they'll get moving on their end,

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:41.790
so let's get going right now.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.860
We can't afford to miss a single place,
so let's all split up.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.330
You got the addresses, right?

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.670
What? You idiot.
You can't even get it to light.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.500
What? Why won't this light?

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:55.810
Let me see it.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.540
Darn it. It's out of fuel.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.580
Hey, go see if you can find another one.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.410
You always make me do the grunt work.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:26.240
Looks like your dad has no intention
of finding you.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.370
This is why motherless kids are pitiful.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:32.510
Imagine if you had a mother
in a situation like this.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.880
She would've dropped everything
to come find you.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.410
Who in the world doesn't have a mother?

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.380
I have a mother too, you know!

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:43.290
Is that right?

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.420
I guess we can just wait here.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:48.530
Mommy will come
looking for her girl, right?

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:55.130
Let's just wait and see
if your mommy shows up or not, shall we?

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.710
I'm heading to the warehouse
in Yeomsa-dong.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.450
The last place was a bust.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.420
I had no luck at all,
so I turned right around.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:15.620
- What about you, Tae Kyung?
- Same here.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.450
This construction site is a bust as well.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.460
Any news? Did you find her?

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.170
It doesn't look like she's here.
It might be the other construction site.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.740
How many wild goose chases is this now?

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.300
Are we even going to find her
by the end of the day at this rate?

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.910
We should call the police now.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.940
Let's just check one last place.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:42.710
It looks like you're closer,
so please head over there right now.

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.880
To the alley with an abandoned building
in Yeomsa-dong.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:06.670
- You can't even get it to light.
- I'll do it.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.140
Let me see.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.610
This idiot can't even get a flame going.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.640
What? Why won't this thing light?

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:18.580
It's a bust.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.280
A total bust.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.720
Not getting a single phone call
means it's over.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.960
So I guess it's time
for us to wrap this up.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.960
Are you going to let me go?

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.290
Do I look like I would do that?

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.160
Then what are you going to do to me?

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.830
What does it look like I'm going to do?

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.640
Darn it!

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.610
Darn it, seriously.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.510
You little brat!

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.080
What are you, a dog?

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.920
Why would you bite me? Darn it!

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.420
Look at you.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.390
Look at this kid.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.660
It's lit! Gosh, finally.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.060
Hey. Forget it.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.100
- Let's get out of here.
- What? Why all of a sudden?

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.040
We're not getting the money anyway,

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.040
so why bother getting our hands dirty?

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.740
Let's see how long you can last in here.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.310
Who knows? You might get lucky
and make it out alive.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.250
Let's go.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.820
Wait, you can't just leave me here!

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.190
Mister!

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:36.760
Hey, mister!

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:41.770
You jerks! You have to untie me
before you go!

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.370
Untie me right now!

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.740
Sir, can you please go a little faster?

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:07.520
Hello? Is anyone there?

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.590
Is nobody here?

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.500
Over here!

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.600
Is anybody here?

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.670
Someone is in here!

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:26.610
Help! Somebody help me!

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.920
